Not affiliated — just sharing the experience because the structure is pretty different from what I usually see.\n\nThe idea is simple:  \nYou hold a small amount of the project’s token to unlock access, and then you can “hire” explorers using BNB. Those explorers generate BNB rewards over time, and the system gives you two main actions:\n\n**• Compound → reinvest rewards to increase the number of explorers**  \n**• Collect → claim the BNB rewards to your wallet**\n\nThe part I found interesting is that the whole thing is powered by transaction fees.  \nThere’s a 2% fee on the project’s token transactions that gets converted into BNB and added to a shared reward pool. Your share of that pool depends on how many explorers you have.\n\nThere are also standard platform fees (4% on deposits and withdrawals), while compounding has no fee — which is why their docs recommend a “7-day compounding strategy” (compound for 7 days, claim on the 8th). It’s basically a gamified system that rewards consistent reinvestment.\n\nThere’s also an on-chain referral layer that gives a small percentage in BNB from deposits and withdrawals of people you refer.\n\nNot saying it’s perfect or better than traditional yield platforms, but the game-like structure + explorer progression makes it feel different from the typical DeFi farm.

On the surface the change looks like more trading hours and fewer forms, but under the hood it reveals important design choices that matter for composability, settlement, and risk management.\n\nHere are the core technical tradeoffs and opportunities I see when you compare traditional brokered markets to an onchain Universal Exchange model (e.g., Bitget) that supports tokenized RWAs.\n\n1. Settlement and finality Traditional markets rely on multi-step clearing and custodial reconciliation, which introduces settlement lag and counterparty exposure. Onchain tokenized stocks can enable near-instant finality for transfers if the token design and custody model support onchain redemption. That reduces intraday counterparty settlement risk, but it also shifts a lot of legal-compliance complexity into token contracts and their real-world redemption processes.\n2. Composability and programmability Once equities exist as onchain tokens, they become composable money legos. You can program automated strategies, wrap positions as derivatives, or integrate tokenized shares into DeFi lending and staking protocols. Architecturally, that requires careful standards for token behavior, permissioning, and access control so financial primitives do not accidentally break regulatory or operational constraints.\n3. Pricing and oracle reliance Accurate, low-latency price feeds are crucial. Onchain markets typically need robust oracle systems with slashing and redundancy to avoid manipulation. The architectural question is whether price discovery remains primarily onchain using native orderbooks, or offchain feeds continue to inform onchain settlement. Both choices affect latency, manipulation surface, and complexity of dispute resolution.\n4. Liquidity and market structure A Universal Exchange model can unify liquidity across spot and derivatives within a single clearing layer, enabling cross-margining and more efficient capital use. However, onchain order books and AMM-style liquidity mechanisms behave differently than centralized matching engines. Designing for tick sizes, order types, and large-block handling requires hybrid approaches or novel liquidity protocols.\n5. Custody, regulatory wrappers, and redemption mechanics Tokenized real-world assets need a credible legal wrapper that ties the token to an underlying claim. The system architecture must include onchain proofs of reserve, clear redemption pathways, and offchain trustee governance. This is where design, law, and operational security intersect; a technically sound token can still fail if its redemption infrastructure is weak.\n6. Risk controls and user experience Margin, liquidations, and credit risk need conservative, transparent rules when applied to RWAs. Onchain automation can enforce risk limits faster, but it also makes system behavior more deterministic and potentially unforgiving. UX improvements such as unified portfolios and cross-product margin are powerful, but they must be paired with clear liquidation mechanics and fail-safes.\n\nI am curious about concrete architectural patterns people have prototyped or audited for these components.

You know how you need MetaMask for anything EVM, then a different wallet like Petra for Aptos, and so on? It's a pain, and using bridges to move assets between them.\n\nSo, [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3763076), called \"HEMVM,\" proposes a really interesting solution. The core idea is creating a single blockchain that can run different virtual machines, specifically EVM and MoveVM, at the same time, and letting them talk to each other seamlessly.\n\nHere's the gist of how it works, from what I gathered:\n\nThe framework creates separate \"sub-spaces\" for each VM. Think of it like running two different operating systems (like Windows and macOS) on one computer, but they are both part of a unified system. They share the same underlying security and consensus layer.\n\nThe cool part is what they call a \"cross-space handler.\" This lets a smart contract on the EVM side directly call a function on a Move contract (and vice-versa) within a single, atomic transaction. No wrapping, no bridges, no waiting. The paper gives an example of using a familiar EVM wallet like MetaMask to directly interact with a Move-based DeFi protocol like PancakeSwap. Imagine swapping tokens on a Move DEX without ever leaving your Ethereum wallet, that’s the kind of thing this could enable.\n\nWhy I think this is interesting: \n\n- For Users: It could solve the headache of managing multiple wallets and chains. You could interact with dApps across different ecosystems using the wallet you already know and trust.\n- For Devs: They wouldn't have to make the hard choice between building for EVM’s massive user base or using the security features of a newer language like Move. They could have the best of both worlds.\n\nThe performance numbers in the paper look promising too. They claim the overhead is minimal (less than 4.4% for regular transactions) and that these cross-VM calls are still really fast, reaching over 300 TPS for complex DeFi stuff and even higher for simple transfers. Plus, since the VMs run in their own lanes, the chain can process transactions for both in parallel, which gives it a big performance boost.\n\nOf course, this is a research paper, not a live product, so it's all theoretical for now. But it’s a fascinating approach to interoperability that feels more integrated than the bridges and multi-chain solutions we have today.\n\nWhat do you all think? Is this a viable path forward, or are there potential security risks or drawbacks to a model like this?

Safety stays the same, but latency drops.\n\nBecause of this, Aptos runs around 100 milliseconds per block on mainnet today.

Been thinking about a nagging problem in DeFi that doesn't get enough attention: the janky state of automation.\n\nIt's 2025, yet if you want to do something as basic as a dollar-cost average (DCA) buy or set a real stop-loss on-chain, you're usually forced to use an external service. You're either paying fees to a keeper network like Chainlink/Gelato or trusting some random bot. It feels like a weirdly centralized and fragile solution for a supposedly decentralized world.\n\nThis leads to the question: why can't the blockchain just handle this itself? Why can't we just tell the protocol, \"execute this for me when X happens\"?\n\nI was digging around and saw that Aptos Labs is trying to tackle this with a feature they call \"Event-Driven Transactions.\" The idea is to bake automation directly into the L1. So you could, in theory, schedule transactions, set triggers based on price, or chain actions together without an external keeper.\n\nThis sounds great on paper, but it immediately made me wonder: If this is such an obvious solution, why aren't more chains doing it?\n\nThere must be reasons why giants like Ethereum and Solana have historically relied on third-party services for this. My guesses are:\n\n→ Bloat + Complexity: Maybe building this into the core protocol is incredibly complex and could slow the chain down or introduce new bugs. State management for millions of pending \"if-then\" transactions sounds like a nightmare. → Security Risks: Does this open up new attack vectors? What if the price oracle it relies on gets manipulated, triggering a cascade of wrongful liquidations? → Economic Model: Is the keeper-as-a-service model (like Chainlink's) just more sustainable? Maybe the fees generated by keepers are essential for their security and it's a model that works.\n\nSo, I'm just throwing this out to the community, especially the devs:\n\nWhat are the real technical trade-offs of building automation directly into an L1 versus using an external network?\n\nAm I missing other projects that are already working on native on-chain automation?

The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**\n\nCrypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.\n\nTraditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.\n\nSome argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.\n\nUsers are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.\n\nHopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.\n\nMaybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 \n\nThere’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems. That would give us the best of both worlds.

While I am continuing to broaden my understanding about crypto and the blockchain, I'm really interested in recommendations for some more specific research. Right now I have a massive funnel of information and I'm basically choking on it all.\n\nWhat really interests me is the potential for crypto and the underlying tech to make private equity and venture capital obsolete, as businesses, creators, and developers are able to use tokens to leverage their community as investors who want to directly support products/people/ideas they believe in and cut out the middle men of VC/PE and wall street (I currently hold stock in some VC/PE firms registered as BDCs because that's as close as I can get to those market opportunities, and also the whole \"accredited investor\" thing is BS, but I digress.) - something in between crowd funding and IPOs that are superior to both.\n\nI had an \"aha\" moment when I was learning about how smart contracts have been used to code royalties into NFTs and stuff, and realized that this technology is vastly superior to the current way that basically the whole stock market operates. In my hopium-fueled future, shareholder agreements are coded on the blockchain and stock is replaced with tokens - and obviously not just stocks, but all sorts of asset classes, IP, etc, that most people don't currently have good access too.\n\nI believe this is referred to as \"tokenization\" - but I'm still learning all the vocabulary - and also there seem to be a lot of different players out there talking about tokenization as part of their use case, but I'm not sure they all mean exactly the same thing or have the same vision for what that looks like.\n\nIf anyone could recommend specific cryptos that are working on this use, I will happily dive into them. I would prefer better known projects as opposed to deep-in-the-weeds altcoins, but if you think the technology is really compelling then I'm happy to look at it and learn even if only for my own edification and better understanding.\n\nThe four that I am currently studying are Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot - not specifically for what I mentioned above, but because they're the ones that are on my current reading list, although they all do seem to have some aspect of tokenization to them (opinions on these welcome).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n  \nP.S.

Let's discuss the concept I am a backend dev working on DeFi projects. Since I started to dive into DeFi deeper, I got an obsessive idea I just have to get out of my system. I’d love to if someone criticises it constructively.\n\nWhy not shape specific decentralised protocol around DeFi?\n\nHere some basic thoughts. DeFi is all about the rules how value should be distributed. There are finite number of tools types serving this purpose. Thus there is no need in classic smart contracts agility. The protocol could have limited but sufficient number of possibilities to launch your own DeFi tool. Users can operate just with high level abstractions, while all essential algorithms are predetermined by node software. It makes the system load predictable. \n\nThis is the place where things become interesting. Since protocol algorithms are predetermined, transactions types should be structurally predetermined as well. However it doesn’t limit us in the number of transactions types. Each type should represent system activity component. For example there should be «place order» txn, «cancel order» txn, «trade» txn, etc. This approach allows to build order book spot markets, derivatives and lending markets right in Layer 1 chain. Which means (1) less intermediaries, (2) less fees, (3) more safety, (4) more usability.\n\nSticking to this idea, we can spread to protocol economic base rethinking. Since we have no need in classic smart contracts system, we have no need in gas concept. So why shouldn’t we squeeze max out of the idea and make «supportive» transactions, such as «place» and «cancel» orders ones, free. In the end one should pay just for beneficial actions, so transactions types like «trade», «open leverage position», «open derivative position» should should incur charges. To prevent pay-2-win behaviour let’s make fees flat, so no one could pay a little bit more to execute one’s order first. Last, to make the system reliable and fast, let’s guarantee valid transaction to be included into upcoming block algorithmically.  \n\nAlright, what do we have so far. Decentralised L1 protocol with flexible, flat fees table across defi segments, which prevents orders front running, excludes additional intermediaries and allows you to build customised defi tools: from L1 order book spot markets to sophisticated derivatives.\n\nBut wait. If there is flat fees table and guarantees that each valid transaction has to be included into new upcoming block, why anyone should care about network maintenance? What’s the motivation to hold full node? How will protocol become truly decentralised? Well, let’s spread transactions fees among node holders evenly. And to make an economic sense out of it, let’s limit the number of node holders participating in fees distribution at a given moment of time. The limit should depend on protocol trade activity: higher activity — higher the number of participants.\n\nAlright, what about speed in terms of consensus? How do we decide who’s block will be included into the chain fast? Let’s make roles system. We could grant the Leader role to one of the node holders and transition it randomly among participating nodes over time. The other nodes become Auditors. To motivate Auditors lets make each node holder provide security deposit. If any Leader’s misbehaviour occurs, the first Auditor reports it earns the Leader’s security deposit and the network accepts Auditor block.\n\nSo, this is the big picture. What do you think?

Captivated by its promise to drastically alter our digital lives, I was particularly moved by its ethos of individual empowerment, which I believe is necessary for a more prosperous society.\n\nOne underexplored yet promising facet of blockchain is its potential to transform corporate structures. This could fundamentally change how we operate, allowing individuals to participate more fully in decision-making and resource allocation. However, current solutions (DAOs) have been disappointing. To address this, I aim to explore how decentralized technologies can help us build more effective and efficient alternatives to our current organizational structures.\n\n# Traditional Structures: The Company\n\nTo innovate on these structures using decentralized tools, we must first understand them from first principles. The company is the modern organizational structure - so lets define it from first principles.\n\nCompanies are a structured collection of individuals united by a common vision, operating under a defined set of principles and processes to execute tasks aimed at achieving that vision, often with the goal of generating more money than it spends.\n\n# Blockchain Innovations: DAOs\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an open, democratic community with operational actions executed on the blockchain. Voting rights and ownership are determined by token holdings, with the nuances of these rights written in code. Examples like Uniswap DAO, The Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Cardano's Project Catalyst illustrate how DAOs operate.\n\n# Where DAOs Went Wrong\n\nDespite their potential, DAOs face significant challenges:\n\n1. **Slow Decision-Making**: The lack of speed hampers their ability to compete with centralized companies.\n2. **Centralization Under the Mask of Decentralization**: In some DAOs, a few token holders control the majority of decisions.\n3. **Laborious and Inaccessible**: DAO interfaces are often not user-friendly, requiring a steep learning curve.\n\n# What DAOs Got Right\n\nDespite these faults, DAOs have made significant strides in:\n\n1. **Decentralization and Reach**: Allowing strangers to collaborate toward a common goal.\n2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Voting and change processes are recorded on an unchangeable ledger.\n\n# Decentralizing Organizations Day-to-Day\n\nImagine buying an NFT that grants you access to specific roles and tasks within an organization. Every task is tied to a smart contract, and once completed, the task manager reviews the work. Upon approval, tokens are distributed to your wallet. This structure can revolutionize how we think about task allocation and completion within organizations.\n\nFor example, a decentralized company could issue NFTs representing different roles, each with associated courses and task bounties. This system incentivizes motivated individuals to complete tasks quickly and efficiently while maintaining decentralization.\n\n# The New Yogurt Times: Decentralized Media Operations\n\nTo experiment with this possibility, I would create a newsletter called The New Yogurt Times (NYT) within Frontier Media. By collaborating with platforms like Working Dead, I would create courses to introduce the company's vision, processes, and specific domain knowledge. NFTs representing different roles (writer, editor, fact-checker) would be minted, each receiving a share of the revenue generated by NYT.\n\nTasks can be managed through platforms like Discord, which support NFT-based permissions, or decentralized storage solutions like Iagon. While some disconnects remain (e.g., integrating NFT permissions with Substack), these can be managed manually for now.\n\n# Revolutionizing Work\n\nDecentralizing day-to-day operations could provide both stability and flexibility, allowing team members to deliver high-quality work while managing their own schedules. This structure can also complement DAOs, which are better suited for long-term, strategic decisions.\n\nMoreover, this system opens the door for AI agents to function within organizations, provided they can access a crypto wallet. By integrating AI into decentralized business processes, we can address the lack of current AI integration in traditional business structures.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis ideation process highlights the potential of decentralized technologies to revolutionize organizational structures. While challenges remain, the possibilities for innovation are immense. I plan to further refine these ideas and potentially write a whitepaper to explore their merits.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this piece.

But when we dig deeper into those TPS numbers, we find some interesting differences between what's claimed and what's real.  \nBlockchain projects like to show off their \"max TPS\" numbers, but it's important to take a closer look to see what's really going on. We're going to break down the difference between TPS numbers that sound impressive and what they actually mean.  \nTo do this, we've used a straightforward approach. We connected to different blockchains, watched transactions closely, and then did some math based on the last 100 blocks. While blockchains have different speeds, we've kept things simple to focus on understanding TPS.  \nLet's check out the TPS claims of Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Bitcoin:  \nSolana claims \"65,000 transactions per second,\" but the real TPS is 299.91. That's a huge 217 times difference.  \nArbitrum talks about \"40,000 transactions per second,\" but the actual TPS is only 8.07. That's a whopping 4956 times difference.  \nAvalanche says \"4,500 transactions per second,\" but the real TPS is just 2.01. That's a significant 2500 times difference.  \nEthereum's max TPS is 56, but the current TPS is 11.14.

While privacy is considered an essential aspect of tradfi , it is often misunderstood and misrepresented in decentralized systems. As the cryptocurrency industry grows, we must define financial privacy in crypto and develop innovative solutions to manage it. It is crucial to emphasize that privacy in crypto is a fundamental requirement to mainstream user and business buy-in rather than a mere nice to have feature. We cannot expect tradfi volumes in DeFi if we don’t offer tradfi level privacy. For example, fund activity will be limited as long as their DeFi alpha is leaked with every transaction they make on-chain.Contrary to popular belief, crypto transactions are not anonymous.. As regulators increase their oversight and blockchain network analysis tools become more sophisticated, the lack of privacy in crypto has become more detrimental. \n\nIn blockchain development, developers have to prioritize between security, decentralization, and scalability, and privacy is not typically one of the primary considerations. Programmable privacy is an emerging sector of research and development that is being implemented in public blockchains to ensure more secure, scalable, and private-yet-compliant transactional volume. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) technology is one such example. A ZKP is a method by which one party can prove to another party that something is true without revealing any additional information. This technology is crucial for supporting use cases that require information to prove statements of truth, without revealing information that isn't relevant. ZKPs are great for privacy because you can assert that you are entitled to send a transaction (i.e., own the assets on-chain) without revealing who you are, what those assets are, or what your transaction history is. ZKPs can be built into EVM chains and provide account level privacy whilst still maintaining protocol level transparency.\n\nIn conclusion, financial privacy is a right that must be protected, and there are tools being researched and developed to ensure this right also applies to crypto. The industry needs to prioritize privacy before it's too late. Education and engagement at the regulatory level are also essential to showcase the benefits of emerging privacy technologies like ZKP.", "lang": null, "likes": 67, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/123j1z1/crypto_privacy_solutions/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Original article: [https://thecryptoanalyst.medium.com/my-top-pick-for-2023-is-alephium-alph-because-it-sets-a-whole-new-security-standard-for-defi-and-8ebe0cb8a64a](https://thecryptoanalyst.medium.com/my-top-pick-for-2023-is-alephium-alph-because-it-sets-a-whole-new-security-standard-for-defi-and-8ebe0cb8a64a)\n\nThe stateful UTXO model will probably constitute a paradigm shift in Defi because it inherently has much higher security for users and devs. The only known iteration of the stateful UTXO model is in Alephium, which also the project that came up with it.  If we consider each *private key* as an owner, then in the Ethereum network each owner has to keep all their eggs in one basket (the account). One of the advantages of keeping everything in one basket is that it improves the programmability of the network. In Bitcoin the eggs of each owner (private key) can be considered as if scattered all over the place. As result the programmability of the UTXO is much lower compared to the account model and the account model with its all eggs in one basket architecture, despite its lower privacy, is key to Ethereum’s smart contract expressiveness. \n\nIn the account model, secondary tokens issued on top of the L1, such as erc20 tokens in Ethereum, are also kept in the same address. So if we start considering also the tokens issued on top of Ethereum, to visualize everything an account contains we can think of a basket with colored eggs, where each color is a different erc20 token. The advantage in terms of programmability here consists in the fact that if we have a smart contract SC that needs to transfer 2 red eggs from A to B once a condition is met, then the smart contract simply moves 2 red eggs from A’s basket into B’s basket.\n\nIt is here that we can also start to visualize the source of the inherent security risks Ethereum’s dapps and defi. Bugs, hacks, exploits etc often inflict losses because everything (for each user) is contained in one basket. So one may authorise a smart contract to move 2 red eggs, but because of a bug the smart contract may take 4 red eggs instead of 2. Or it may take a yellow egg instead of a red one. Or it may be manipulated to move all eggs of all colours and empty the basket completely. This is the inherent risk that Alephium’s stateful UTXO model eliminates. stUTXO is defined as a hybrid of the account and UTXO model, but the easiest way to visualise it is as a way for an owner to create multiple baskets with the same private key. And just like in the UTXO mode, from the outside these new baskets are completely disconnected and impossible to associate with each other.\n\nIn Alephium, while you can keep all eggs in one basket, you can also create a new basket where for example you put the 3 green eggs that are supposed to interact with a specific smart contract. As result of this, since the smart contract doesn’t get to touch or know where the other eggs are, there is no way for you to lose by mistake, through a smart contract bug or hack other eggs you own in the network. The smart contract interacts only with the basket with 3 green eggs, doesn’t see or get close to any pink/blue/yellow eggs you (may) own. This is from my understanding the superior inherent security and better UX that Alephium’s stateful UTXO model brings.", "lang": null, "likes": 20, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/101ar31/stateful_utxo_explained_a_new_accounting_model/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

The struggle to excel in all three areas at the same time is known as the \"blockchain trilemma.\" Nowadays, many well-known blockchains (like Ethereum) are unable to scale properly, which means network fees are high and transaction confirmation time is long. To answer its own scaling problems, the Cardano network aims to implement Hydra.  \n\n&gt;*Hydra: A family of protocols that overlay the layer 1 Cardano blockchain to process transactions off the main chain. Hydra uses the main ledger as the secure settlement layer, boosts throughput, minimizes the delay in starting to process transactions, incurs low to no costs, and greatly reduces storage requirements.*\n\nBefore we get into Hydra, let’s take a look at some other popular methods for scaling blockchains:\n\n* **Layer-2**: A Layer-1 (L1) is the underlying blockchain and serves as the foundation for a Layer-2 (L2). There can only be one L1, but there can be multiple L2s (for example, Ethereum is the L1 while Optimism, Arbitrum, and Loopring are all L2s for Ethereum). L2s exist on top of L1s and help reduce scaling limitations and transaction costs by splitting the transaction confirmation process in two: L2 for executing transactions and code while L1 handles security, data, and the public ledger. L2s come in several different flavors, like **Optimistic Rollups** (which assume bundles of transactions are valid on default and if any discrepancies are found a fraud proof is initiated to fully verify the transaction), **ZK Rollups** (which operate similarly to Optimistic Rollups, but have validity proofs for every bundle of transactions which are sent to the L1 instead of processing each individual transaction), and **VALIDIUM (**which are essentially ZK Rollups but transaction data is stored off chain and only submit validity proofs and state commitments to the L1). \n* **Sidechains:** Instead of relying on the security provided by the parent chain (like an L1 provides for an L2), a sidechain creates its own independent ecosystem that is connected to the parent chain through a two-way bridge. This means that the parent chain can “decongest” when some transactions are moved to the sidechain. \n* **Sharding:** In contrast to the first two solutions, sharding distributes the load of managing the large amount of data required by rollups across the entire network. This will drastically reduce the cost of storing data on L1. \n\n**Hydra**\n\nHydra is similar to an L2 since Hydra takes transactions off the main chain while using the main chain for final settlements. The off-chain location where participants take their transactions is known as a Hydra head, and transactions in the head will Currently, one Hydra head will include a relatively small number of participants.\n\nThe amount of funds that are designated to a Hydra head during the initial construction of a head are exactly equal to the funds that return to the main chain after closing the head. No funds can be created or destroyed off-chain. Before closing the head, the final state of the head is recorded, including how much funds each participant has after all transactions in the head. The funds that were locked on the main chain during initial construction are then returned to participants in accordance with the distribution outlined in the final head state snapshot. In other words, multiple transactions may occur in the head, but the main chain may skip from the initial snapshot to the final snapshot of the distribution of the funds, reducing the number of transactions on-chain. \n\nAs for the consensus algorithm in the Hydra heads themselves, a simple solution is used: *every* participant has to agree on *all* transactions. As a result, a participant cannot lose his or her funds without providing consent. This consensus algorithm, while simple, prevents heads from having too many participants or participants who are offline for extended periods of time. So initial implementations of Hydra heads will largely be limited to entities with high performance that are online for extended periods (like stake pools).\n\n&gt;*If you enjoyed reading this, consider following/clapping.

However, when Ethereum moved to PoS it lost its decentralization, but we can see other successful networks that run on PoS and keep being decentralized.\n\nMoreover, in terms of usage, to ensure the network is secure, fast and cheap we also need to look at the project's utility, supply and demand.

Multichain can also transfer NFTs just as it can transfer tokens. To carry out these transfers, Multichain uses a network of nodes.

With the latest events regarding hacks and exploits, especially the recent news of 3AC doxxing their customers, privacy rights have to be ensured if cryptocurrencies in general stand any chance for scalability and mainstream adoption.  At this point, it should be absolutely easy for anyone to keep a private balance and maintain an anonymous profile while interacting with smart contracts. This is one of the reasons why Railgun is highly appreciated within the PriFi space for going a step further by making it possible for anyone to seamlessly use its privacy solution since the platform itself is not token-gated. Its low barrier for usage is characterized by users being able to transact stablecoins and perform Defi privately, even on mobile. It is not a privacy coin, unlike Monero and ZCash. Therefore, you can maintain your privacy without being subjected to price volatility. \n\nSimilar to every other invention in the technological era, privacy in cryptocurrency might have some drawbacks. But in the end, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks and might as well be among the most important features that are required for cryptocurrency to go mainstream.\n\nHow important do you think privacy is to Defi and crypto users in general?", "lang": null, "likes": 20, "replies": 46, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/y8r9vf/how_important_is_privacy_to_crypto_users/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Privacy has become one of the most exciting areas of cryptography research alongside projects building focused on privacy.  We’re also witnessing the development of regulatory frameworks that are focused on privacy, such as the American Data Privacy and Protection Act and the EU parliamentary recommendations, which may affect the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. \n\nVitalik Buterin, Founder of Ethereum, made a comment that privacy will become one of the major focus areas in 2023 - this means there’s a big chance that smart contract privacy will continue to expand. The main technology used in privacy is called zero-knowledge proofs, which is quite advanced and arguably better to understand than mixers (which TC uses to obfuscate transaction details). zk-snarks allows for privacy by mathematically preventing information from being revealed while still allowing the protocol to guarantee that transactions execute correctly.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are divided into Zk-stark and zk-snarks, which require a non-zero amount of computation; if they are to be implemented on a larger scale, computation could be a limiting factor. There are other privacy-preserving projects, such as Aztec Protocol which make use of zk-rollups. Additionally, Starkware Industries is using STARK technology to improve scalability and privacy on Ethereum, while Secret Network is building secret contracts that will enable computation over encrypted data.  \n\nRailgun is another on-chain privacy protocol built on the Ethereum mainnet that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-snarks) to obfuscate transaction details and offer users privacy without the need for bridges or mixers. This shines a major light on how robust its security is, considering how bridges have been a major concern due to their susceptibility to hacks and exploitations. However, Railgun offers privacy on a layer 1 level without the need for bridges, making it more secure.  \nThere’s been a lot of talk about Railgun due to its privacy technology and timely development, which has been quite impressive relative to the window period it takes other solutions to attain a peak in their development. It happened to be among the few PriFi solutions to launch a private wallet (Railway wallet), the world's first EVM-compatible zk-snark prover that runs on web, desktop, and mobile platforms. This is a huge advancement in privacy tech, as it greatly increases access to private DeFi so that privacy can be easily accessed from anywhere. Now, the prospective release of the Railgun SDK will also offer more privacy solutions when integrated on other crypto dApps or platforms.  \nThis all goes without saying that users have become more meticulous about their finances; privacy is gradually becoming a major focus in cryptocurrency. Despite the controversy around regulations, as well as privacy and the need for it in DeFi, there is a need to balance privacy, protection, and transparency. The latter has been proven to be possible through the view-only wallet that is characterized by Railgun’s unique key viewing feature, where a key can be generated to share private transactions with another party. This allows a user to cryptographically prove his transaction history for auditing or other purposes if the legitimacy of the users’ funds and activity is questioned. Other privacy preserving systems are likely working on this, but I don’t think I’m aware of any other project that has this feature enabled. \n\nWithout a doubt, privacy preserving protocols will continue to present many interesting theoretical and practical opportunities in cryptocurrency. This is exciting to look forward to, considering the propositions that have been made about mainstream adoption over the next couple of years.", "lang": null, "likes": 146, "replies": 45, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/y756r2/privacy_and_anonymity_enabled_in_crypto_through/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Anyone may lend or borrow.  \n\n\nIn comparison to CeFi, DeFi borrowing and lending provides advancements in efficiency, access, and transparency. Unlike traditional banks and the CeFi platforms listed above, which require users to provide personal information, proof of identity, and go through KYC (know your customer) procedures, DeFi enables anybody to become a borrower and a lender.\n\n**Lets breakdown what is in for us when we borrow or lend from DeFi:**\n\nUsers who wish to serve as lenders can deposit their coins into smart contracts built using the DeFi protocol. They will receive freshly created tokens that are specific to the protocol in exchange. These redeemable tokens serve as a representation of the principal and interest. The annual percentage yield (APY), or interest rate, which is defined by the ratio between provided and borrowed tokens in a specific market, includes the rate of exchange between native tokens and tokens deposited.\n\nThose who wish to borrow money may select one of these processes and provide collateral. The fact that these loans are over-collateralized is a key component. In other words, borrowers put up as collateral a larger sum of cryptocurrency than they borrow.\n\n**So fast forward DYOR, I came across a DeFi which has an efficient working methodology.**\n\n**Aquarius Loan:**  \nWhat Aquarius Loan does is it provides a variety of DeFi solutions in a reliable, secure, and reasonably priced way, Aquarius seeks to contribute to the development and maturation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) area.  \n\n\nDeFi services may be found in abundance on Aquarius Loan. Aquarius is a decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), as well as a decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing protocol that runs on the widely-known BitTorrent Chain (BTTC). Users may exchange, lend, and borrow a variety of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins using the power of smart contracts, all while benefiting from quick transaction speeds, top-notch security, and affordable transaction fees  \n.\n\nUsers will be able to create appealing APYs on their assets as liquidity providers (LPs). They will be able to borrow different crypto assets as borrowers as long as they offer the required collateral. Additionally, $ARS token owners will have the opportunity to take part in decentralized decision-making processes and influence the direction of the Aquarius Loan protocol as stakeholders.

This time we have some more. Hopefully, it doesn’t get too complicated. If it does ask for clarification in the comment section.\n\n**CIP-31**\n\nCardano Improvement Proposal 31 (CIP-31) allows for a new type of input to transactions: reference inputs. These reference scripts will hold information on the output of a transaction without spending that transaction.\n\nCurrently, if a Cardano dApp developer wants to access the outputs of a transaction (to which address does the ADA go and how much is sent and left over), the UTXO must be spent and then recreated. This wastes time (since dApps will have to wait for the next block to recreate the UTXO) and incurs more transaction fees. CIP-31 will greatly improve the efficiency of dApps by allowing them to access more information without paying an extra fee. Ultimately, VASIL will allow transactions with reference inputs to be put on the blockchain for one transaction fee and then that information will be available to all for no extra cost.\n\n**CIP-33**\n\nCIP-33 allows outputs of a transaction to have another editable field: reference scripts. Previously, if a smart contract wanted to use a script in a transaction, it would need to contain the entire script. This makes the size of transaction data larger and incurs greater gas fees for users and dApp developers. With CIP-33, a transactions reference script field will contain a short address that points to the location of the script on the blockchain. So, multiple transactions can use the same script by just referencing it instead having to rewrite the script in every transaction, so any common scripts can become reusable across the blockchain.\n\n**CIP-40**\n\nThis improvement proposal is pretty simple. CIP-40 is meant to protect dApp developers from losing extra funds if they make a mistake while building applications. Transactions using smart contracts require some collateral of ADA to cover the costs of contracts failing, but developers can put more than the minimum amount. CIP-40 gives the extra ADA back if a contract fails and the developer had put more than the minimum amount of collateral. This prevents developers from experiencing unnecessary losses of ADA.\n\nAs you can probably tell, the VASIL hard fork brings many intuitive changes to the Cardano blockchain — improving its speed and usability without compromising on security. Even though the Cardano blockchain is already much more efficient compared to others (like Ethereum and Bitcoin), the future entails many more Cardano users, which can overload the blockchain. To counter this, Cardano needs more hard forks like VASIL (which are planned to occur in the [Basho](https://adacrunch.medium.com/5-years-of-never-ending-innovation-happy-birthday-cardano-d93ea7f91de3#:~:text=Japan%E2%80%99s%20Edo%20Period-,Basho%20%7C%20Scaling%3A,-From%20Cardano%E2%80%99s%20roadmap) era).", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/xwoply/what_exactly_is_the_vasil_hard_fork_in_simple/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

After cryptocurrencies turned up, the functioning of which is carried out in a decentralized network, Internet users could make transfers to each other without the help of intermediaries. Thanks to this, sharing personal information about yourself is unnecessary to make payments. This feature of cryptocurrencies has become one of the main arguments that their supporters put forward to justify the advantages of this technology over conventional electronic money. This advantage has a serious flaw: the cryptocurrency owner only needs to violate security measures once (for example, to purchase crypto on the exchange by a simple bank transfer) for his identity to be disclosed.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which holds transactions performed inside the system into a completely transparent distributed database. If desired, any user of the system can determine how much cryptocurrency was transferred, when and to which wallets. Thus, the security of users from the point of view of anonymity is imaginary. Fortunately, anonymity adepts have created specialized services — crypto mixers. \n\n### What Is a Crypto Mixer?\n\nA crypto mixer is a service, in the form of an app or website, that mixes a certain amount of your coins with coins of other owners, after which the origin of the coins cannot be tracked. This is a way to “confuse the traces” during transactions so that no one reveals where the digital assets in the wallet came from, who they belong to and where they go. Thus, crypto mixers increase the level of security and anonymity.\n\n### Why Are Crypto Mixers Used?\n\nCryptocurrency is a convenient means of payment. With the help of cryptocurrency, fast execution of P2P transfers is ensured. The payment is unknown to the fiscal authorities, and transactions are not carried out via bank accounting registers. At the same time, information about all transactions is stored in a distributed network without reference to a specific person. Data analysis will allow you to track the chain of transfers and identify the initial or final owner.\n\nIn addition, the cryptocurrency is used for settlements on the black market, including on the Darknet.\n\nHowever, anonymizing the transfer is not always associated with illegal actions. There are reasonable reasons to hide a user’s transaction history:\n\n* Transaction security\n* The unwillingness of a particular user to show the presence of an asset\n\nCrypto mixers are used to:\n\n* Eliminate the possibility for attackers to track transactions of law-abiding owners of digital assets\n* Protect personal information\n* Protect against the theft of assets by fraudsters  \n\n\n### Types of Crypto Mixers\n\nThere are two main types of mixers — centralized and peer-to-peer.   \n\nCentralized mixers are traditional services where the mixing of coins occurs by sending a transaction and receiving the amount back in several transfers from other users selected randomly. If many people use the service, it becomes challenging to link the incoming and outgoing transactions of the same user.\n\nHowever, there are two problems with centralized mixers:\n\n* First, you need to trust the service itself. After all, it has information about user transactions and, if desired, can transfer it to third parties.\n* Secondly, there is still a small chance of falling into the hands of scammers who only disguise themselves as a mixer and simply collect user coins without sending anything in return.\n\nPeer-to-peer mixers are anonymizers that solve both problems of centralized services. Peer-to-peer mixers are platforms where owners of digital assets are grouped to form transactions. None of the participants has information about other users, mixing stages, and proportions. Transactions go through several mixes before they get to wallets. The order and number of coins are determined randomly.\n\n### How Does Crypto Mixer Work?\n\nThe algorithm for working with the mixer is quite simple and may vary slightly from service to service, but in general, everything looks like this:\n\n1. Buy crypto (if you don’t have it yet).\n2. Send coins to a crypto mixer.\n3. Coins are mixed. Here you can choose the degree/time of mixing and/or the amount of commission (all these factors are directly related to the mixing quality).\n4. You receive a letter of guarantee from the crypto mixer, which in case of problems, will help you contact technical support and figure out what’s going on because the mixer does not store or require any data about you.\n5. You get the same coins, but already from among the mixed ones.\n\nThe most crucial thing is to choose a crypto mixer so as not to send your crypto funds to scammers. To begin with, try sending a small amount to check the operation of the service, and if everything goes well, mix a large number of coins.  \n\n\n### The Legality of Using Crypto Mixers\n\nIn May 2022, the United States imposed sanctions against the popular crypto mixer Blender.io, in August — against the Tornado Cash ETH mixer. Earlier in 2020 and 2021, Helix, Coin Ninja, and Bitcoin Fog were hit.\n\nThe reason is that mixers are expected to become an effective tool for criminals. Although technologies for demixing transactions already exist, the use of services is still very common.\n\nAt the same time, mixers in most jurisdictions are not considered explicitly illegal. For example, in the USA, they are classified as money transfer services, and each of them is obliged to:\n\n* Register with FinCEN\n* Develop and implement KYC/AML measures\n* Keep records and comply with the requirements of the regulator\n\nOf course, there is little use from such mixers, where you must pass identity verification. Therefore, at the moment, no known crypto mixer would follow these rules.\n\nSince 2020, the use of mixers has increased significantly, and although the rapid growth has calmed down somewhat in 2022, it remains close to record highs. The increase is due to high volumes from centralized crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, and addresses associated with illegal activities. According to Chainanalysis, illegal addresses account for 23% of all funds.\n\nCrypto mixers are a problematic dilemma for regulators and crypto community members. It is impossible to deny that financial privacy is the right of every person. But the data shows that cybercriminals benefit the most from such services.\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nThe program's advantage is hiding the history of previous transactions to get “clean” coins. However, using crypto mixers does not provide a 100% guarantee anonymity. It is possible to decipher the transaction history of a coin that has passed the mixing procedure. Clustering analysis is used for this. Clustering analysis is a special technique that helps to decipher many well-known services. So, similar algorithms were created by Bitfury and Chainalysis. With the help of clustering analysis, it becomes possible to establish interconnected crypto addresses even via a mixer.\n\nIn addition, among the programs for anonymizing digital assets, some services deceive users. It is possible to identify intruders only by reviews on forums. None of the victims will complain to the police.\n\nThanks a lot for reading!

I researched a bit to understand what blockchain-technology has to offer in this regard (e.g. running decentralized social media platforms). If we take reddit as an example: What are the main  prerequisites to run such a platform?\n\n* Speed: Let's assume users create  10 posts per second on reddit.  Add other actions like up-/downvoting, commenting, etc. and all the necessary calls involved in storing/indexing/querying  data related to those posts, you quickly get a way higher number. We easily can reach thousands of calls per second.\n* Storage and storage cost: Posts not only consist of short text. Graphics/Images, animated GIFs and videos need a lot of space, even if scaled down and compressed efficiently. According to several sources you can find via Google, in 2020 1.4 billion videos where uploaded every month!\n* Decentralization and reliability: To store all this data and make it available anytime, everywhere you need mirrors of the storages. You also need strong decentralization, so no party can remove chunks of data (may they be big or small) on their own.\n\nI make the \"bold statement\", that we currently don't have the blockchain technology to meet the above mentioned prerequisites. I also think, that these are major hurdles, we need to take, to make \"Web3\" happen (if it is not reduced to what it is right now). \n\nIf one asks about speed, a typical answer is Solana or some other CC with high TPS. The issue with that is, that we are talking about finite state applications in case of storing crypto-transactions. And even under this circumstances, Solana is not well decentralized. So the speed- and decentralization-requirements are not met with current blockchains to make \"Web3 social media\" happen.\n\nWhat about storage and storage cost? Looking at Arweave, Filecoin, Storj, etc. the costs are way too high. Want to give an upvote and want that upvote to be stored, so others can see it? Well, pay 0,10 € for it! Want to upload a video with your post and share it with the world? Better start saving up on your pocket money!  \nSo, how to store all of the data created each day, make it available all the time? True decentralization means, that there is nobody, who pays for the storage. And users certainly won't do it. History showed over and over again: If there is an alternative, that looks like it is \"free\" (which facebook, Instagram, etc. are certainly not!), they will use it. Even it they are selling themselfes for it (to be fair: most people didn't realize and understood, what companies like facebook where doing – by now everybody and their mothers should understood it).\n\n**TL;DR &amp; question:**\n\nWhat do you think, guys?

One wallet does not support bitcoin segwit but supports TRON, another one only applies Cosmos Network, and etc. I came across an article by Bob Stewell \"Do Unhosted Wallets Dream of Network Fees?\". He argues that due to the fact that blockchains do not reward crypto-wallets they are not in a hurry to make a multi-currency crypto-wallet, which are needed for comfortable usage.\n\nHere where I came to understanding why all those problems are happening. For example, I realized why there are huge purchase fees and a bad exchange rate in wallets. We often have to refer to p2p, CEXs, and DEXs just because of it. In case someone out of the crypto world needs to explain how to switch from one currency to another, the disaster is happening. Oh, I guess the support is the main issue here! At the beginning of my crypto way, I was waiting for answers for several days, and as a result, I’ve figured everything out by myself.\n\nEvery time a new blockchain project that is not supported by one or another wallet is released you have to install a specific application. \n\nThere are many places where the wallet is imported via a 12-word seed phrase, and a 24-word seed phrase is often found in new ones ... Is it so difficult to make a choice? And then I found out that these seed phrases may be in different languages! Even in Chinese, and not all wallets support it also! As for me, I have been using cryptocurrencies for more than 5 years now and I see that wallets are developing really slow. It got so bad that I'm already thinking of developing a wallet myself. \n\nBob believes that the problem essence is in the monetization model - wallets live off a percentage of the purchase or exchange. Adding all the variety of blockchains for wallets is resource-intensive, and wallet revenues will not grow much from this. For me as a user, the problem is really serious, since the ecosystems of Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Polygon, and others are actively developing, and it is impossible to use them all in one wallet.\n\nFrankly, it is much more natural for a wallet that offers a variety of blockchains to provide a range of payment systems and exchangers. But no one does this, because the more profitable this exchange for the user is, the less the wallet’s profit is, or there is even no profit at all. This is a bad system.\n\nThe problem is in the blockchains themselves: they pay miners, they pay stackers, but they don't pay wallets. It seems to me that blockchains can change this situation and start stimulating wallets, and this will give an impetus to development, and strengthen competition. Wallets will fight each other to become number 1! To make the most convenient and intuitive interface (this is a problem for many wallets). \n\nThe solution is the integration of the mechanism into the blockchain, which will send part of the network transaction fee to the wallet that helped the user to carry out this transaction. Then the functionality and service of wallets will improve significantly.

Repost from r/cc since responses were brutal Repost:\n\nIn any blockchain, take bitcoin for example, the previous block's hash is added to the new block. This makes it so that the order of blocks cannot be changed. In other words, it creates an immutable and chronological sequence of events. A \"proof of history,\" if you will...\n\nAm I missing something, or is this no different from what bitcoin and any other blockchains do with hashes in blocks?\n\nAfter reading deeper into it it seems like the main difference is that instead of having a node find a block and broadcast it to all other nodes who then individually audit the TXs in the new block and individually cross-reference each other, Solana chooses a \"leader\" validator via PoS who finds a block, broadcasts it to all other nodes and then tallies the votes from all the other nodes themselves rather than all nodes cross-referencing each other's votes and determining the majority decision (i.e. broad consensus)\n\nit seems like this \"leader\" model where one party counts votes and determines consensus instead of all nodes reviewing all other nodes' votes and determining majority consensus, is what sets it apart and allows for massive throughput and speed.\n\nPLS correct me if I am off or just way wrong on this. I've been trying to understand exactly what PoH is for hours today and outside of the whitepaper, I can't find any decent material that really breaks it down in an honest and simple way. Everywhere I see it written about it is described as this massive innovation but it seems to be exactly the process of hashing in sha256 and new blocks having the hash from old blocks. In fact, it sounds like it is literally proof of work just rebranded.\n\nAlso, I hate to get all fuddy, but if I am correct then this system obviously sacrifices vast amounts of decentralization for speed/scalability far beyond arguments commonly seen around crypto subs like hardware requirements, token distribution, etc.\n\nSomeone responded with this [writeup](https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/BJywSZY9t), but this is just out of reach of my technical level.

So if it's a 80% platform then this means for every $100 you put up you can only borrow $80. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith using this idea these smart contracts can be copy and modify a little to add a few features for renters. The only person that puts up money is the renter. And the required coin could be a stable coin. So what happens is this.\n\n1. Landlord setups on the contract on some site saying how much it cost to rent the place and down deposit, the type of coin (like which stable coin), length of time, and the contract the person renting will signed.\n2. The renter will sign along with the landlord somehow signing it with their wallets. That away joe blow that isn't apart of the deal isn't messing with things, and it is hard attached to the 2 wallets.\n3. The renter will have to deposit the first month and down deposit down.\n4.

If it doesn't see it then based on the settings the landlord gave the renter might lose their deposit automatically. \n5. At the end of the contract period (like yearly when the landlord redoes the rent) the landlord can update the contract on file, the number, and it starts back at 2.\n6. At the end of everything, if the person meets the terms to get their deposit back then the landlord can release the deposit in to the renter's wallet.\n\nThis does 2 things. The first is the landlord can't do a surprise now your rent is double. But this also makes it where they don't have to exactly worry about the renter not paying.

Opening financial products up to all is a great idea, but as it stands today we are severely limiting the innovation and development that can happen in the space because the tools we have are extremely inadequate.\n \nSolidity (and most of the programming languages used for smart contracts today) are general purpose languages - you can build anything with them. But because they’re so generalized, they don’t do a very good job at the one thing that you need most for DeFi and crypto - managing tokens.\n\nIn Solidity, tokens are created as a list of account balances (uint256’s) inside an ERC20 smart contract (e.g. account 0x...123 has 50 tokens, 0x...456 has 100 tokens, etc). To execute a token transfer, a message is sent to the contract with instructions to update a particular account’s balance. But because Solidity has no native concept of an asset, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) doesn’t know the difference between a uint256 that represents a token, and a uint256 that represents any other variable. \n\nLogic around asset behavior, such as the fact that a token shouldn’t be in two places at once, doesn’t exist - the developer has to implement this kind of logic from scratch, for every single contract. It’s like using a swiss army knife to make sushi - sure it can just about do the job, but the sushi gets hacked to pieces. No wonder we see hacks pretty much every week with Solidity smart contracts.\n\nSo, what is the right tool for the job? Well first, what is the job? Defi is the big use case for crypto. Handling assets, handling value represented by tokens. So, we need a tool designed from the outset to handle tokens. \n\nIn Scrypto, assets are a native feature of the language. To create a token in Scrypto, you just call a native function directly within the language. For example “.new_token_fixed(1000)” creates a token with a fixed supply of 1000. To transfer the token, you can call on native functions such as “.take(1)”, which takes a single token, or “.send(1)” which sends a single token somewhere. These tokens are guaranteed to behave like physical assets (like a physical coin), as they always have to live in only one place, which makes it way more intuitive.\n\nBeing intuitive has two massive upsides. First, it makes it easier, which means the barrier to entry for developers is lower. This will get more devs programming more dapps with less limits on innovation. The second upside is it makes dapps more secure. If you can easily see how assets will behave, you can easily pick out when they're going to misbehave. That makes programming and auditing far easier.\n\nScrypto is still in development, but the \"alpha\" release, Alexandria, has just come out . This allows it to be run on a private, local (ie offline), instance of the Radix network. Dapps can be developed and tested here, before going live on the real network next year. \n\nThis early release is both to familiarise developers with the new language and mindset, and also for the team to get feedback on any shortcomings that might exist, and how they can be addressed. I'll post a link below if you're interested in diving deeply into this. If you're a developer just starting out, then maybe giving the documentation a look could really help you make your ideas a reality.", "lang": null, "likes": 88, "replies": 273, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/rh1m82/shifting_the_paradigm_for_dapp_development/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Users are still able to create as many swap pairs as they like among each of the assets, however. \n\nAnd as the exchange is built atop the Sienna Network, which itself is powered by the Cosmos-based Secret Network, many of the interoperability questions will be answered once Cosmos finalizes its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) upgrade.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "pnzv9o", "author": "SenatusSPQR", "handle": "SenatusSPQR", "created_utc": 1631614107.0, "text": "The risks of staking for the long-term crypto environment (originally posted as a Medium article and on r/cc, hoping for some better discussion here)\n\nStaking is one of the more recent buzzwords in crypto. It allows you to earn “passive income”. Different chains offer different implementations of staking. Some make staking very easy, some have high returns on staking, and in all cases you supposedly help secure the network.\n\nIn this post, I explain why if you are invested in a Proof of Stake crypto you might want to dig deeper into your choice as all might not be as rosy as it seems.\n\n# Pointless staking yield\n\nWhat makes most people enthusiastic about staking is that by staking, you earn more tokens as a reward. You make money, without doing anything! These tokens have to come from somewhere. In most projects, staking rewards come primarily from supply inflation. You might receive a 6% yield on your tokens, which seems fantastic until you realise that the supply is also expanding at 6% per year. In other words — in this case you’re not actually gaining anything.\n\nWhen you hold 100 tokens out of a total of 1000 and get 6 extra tokens at the end of a year, you’re not gaining when the total supply has increased to 1060. In both cases, you hold 10% of the supply. This is what I would call pointless staking in its most extreme form.\n\nNot all staking cryptos pay for the yield purely by increasing the supply. This brings us to the next aspect of staking.\n#Redistribution through staking\n\nWhen staking isn’t as simple as everyone gaining an equal percentage, there inherently has to be some redistribution. It might be that you gain 7%, while supply only increases by 6%. This is only possible if not everyone gains 7%. How is this possible? There are two options, broadly speaking:\n\n1. Yield consists of a combination of inflation and fees paid or;\n1. Yield is paid from block rewards increasing supply, but supply is at the same time decreased through burning transaction fees.\n\nThe first option is the most basic and oldest form of staking, and is most comparable to Proof of Work. In Proof of Work, you gain a block subsidy for mining a block, and you get the fees paid for the transactions in the block. The same holds true in staking. Stakers are paid (a percentage of) the block reward and fees paid for transactions. The 7% staking reward you get might therefore come from increased supply (6%) and from fees paid (1%).\n\nThe second option is an option that tries to hide the centralization over time by not having fees accrue to stakers but rather having them burnt. This means that the fees are sent to a burn account, that cannot be accessed. As an example, stakers might get a 7% staking reward, which consists of 5% block rewards, and a 2% decrease in supply due to fees being burnt. While good for you as a staker, there is an obvious downside to both options.\n# Discouragement of using the crypto\n\nIf you pay fees to use the chain, while getting staking rewards for not using the chain, there is a clear disconnect. Those using the chain will hold less and less of the supply, while those staking hold an ever larger share of the supply. While you as a staker would be happy with the yield you are getting, users would clearly be happier if they could pay lower fees, and might look to cheaper and more efficient solutions.\n\nPerhaps those staking also have an interest in using the network sporadically. In this case, staking still leads to centralization over time. Fees are denoted in absolute terms (say 0.1 XYZ), rather than relative to your holdings. If small and big holders both transact, the small holder is paying a far larger percentage of his holdings in fees than the large holder is.\n\nIn a scenario where small holders hold 1 XYZ, large holders hold 1000 XYZ, and transaction fees are 0.1 XYZ, a single transaction costs a painful 10% of the holdings of the small holder, while the large holder would barely feel the 0.0001% fee.\nDouble discouragement through lock-up periods\n\nIt potentially gets even worse. Many staking cryptocurrencies force you to lock up your crypto to receive staking rewards. This is the model ETH2 is using as well. When you lock up your tokens, you can’t use them until after the lock-up period. As a small holder, you might be okay locking up some of your tokens (longer-term savings), but you also need some tokens for usage.\n\nA large holder might also want to use some of their tokens occasionally, but can lock up a far larger percentage. We see this in traditional finance — the richer you are, the larger the percentage of your net worth that is invested rather than in cash.\n\nBecause of this, while you might get just 5% on your total holdings as you keep some funds available to use, large holders might be getting 6.9% as they are able to lock up almost all their tokens.\nFurther centralization through staking pools\n\nTaking ETH2 as an example again, setting up a staking pool is not cheap. ETH requires 32 ETH staked (~$100k) to participate in validation. If you don’t have 32 ETH, which many of us do not, you have to join a pool to stake. Pools charge fees for this, either a fixed fee per month or a percentage (10–25%). This fee once again accrues to larger holders.\n\nIn other chains such as Cardano setting up a stake pool is far cheaper. Regardless, the same holds true. There are costs to set up a stake pool, and there are fees associated with joining a stake pool. Those with large holdings become ever larger, while small holders hold relatively less and less.\n#Summarizing the futility of staking\n\nProof of Stake has two possible results. Either everyone stakes, no redistribution happens, and nothing is gained for anyone through staking. The other option is that not everyone is rewarded equally for staking, causing redistribution. This redistribution inevitably accrues to the largest holders, causing centralization of consensus power and supply over time.\n\nBecause of this, I believe that Proof of Stake makes small holders relatively poorer, rather than richer. At the same time, staking decreases decentralization &amp; security, therefore decreasing the value of the protocol as a whole.\n\nFor those interested, I’ve written about methods to avoid [centralization over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize). I’ve also [written about Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an), a cryptocurrency that has 0% inflation, 0 fees, and that remains decentralized and secure over time.\n\nThanks for reading.

Not with ETH but with basically any other POS SC \n\n\nBut I was thinking what if there were some way to monetize those coins which are serving as POS to offset some of the inflation? \n\nCould it count as proof of stake if a validator wasnt holding, say, SOL but was instead holding a yield earning token that represented SOL plus a yield from a SOL yearn-like vault? You can remove tokens at any time from a vault so you can always get the SOL back. (Technically youd get wSOL out of a vault but you can always change wSOL to SOL anyway.) Then the coins would be earning a yield that could be used to offset inflation of POS. And a ytoken IS arguably an IOU of that underlying token... could it serve as POS?\n\nAdmittedly this means the network security is now exposed to risks inherent in other dapps and maybe that is unacceptable. But the inflation on Solana right now compared to the fees generated is totally unsustainable.\n\nAlternately maybe the coins stay in the validator but them as collateral to borrow stablecoins to deposit on Yearn or something. Of course that also has limitation...what happens if the coins start crashing in value and the coins are at risk of liquidation? How do you even borrow against coins locked in POS?

It introduces a bottom-up approach to building new financial infrastructure, allowing users to police network activity and help dictate the direction of each project. Unlike the financial and capital formation systems that govern us today, users themselves wield the power.\n\nPublic blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate according to these standards. Bitcoin was created in part to provide a check on central bankers that are prone to mismanaging money supplies and abusing their immense power. Ethereum unlocked the ability to create globally accessible programmable applications that can be governed by a community of token holders and open-source contributors. These models created the conditions for realizing the first part of Naval’s thesis for crypto: maximum decentralization.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin and Ethereum excel at distributing power to the many, their current public-by-default designs will likely not provide a full solution for Naval’s second outcome - maximum privacy - now or anytime soon.\n\nThis lack of user privacy stands out starkly in the modern age of surveillance capitalism and state-level surveillance. The transparency of Bitcoin and Ethereum may only feed into these existing concerns. They enable end-to-end surveillance on every financial transaction for each wallet, and supplementary solutions like mixers face liquidity and usability challenges that may limit the level of privacy they can offer.\n\nPrivacy coins like Monero and Zcash sprung up to address these issues. They use complex cryptography to obfuscate transaction details, thereby preserving user privacy and increasing security. But they fall short in meeting the demands of DeFi users since neither supports smart contracts at this time, creating a gap in the market.\n\nSecret Network aims to fill this void. It’s one of the first blockchains to support programmable smart contracts with privacy by default, which launched on the Secret mainnet in September 2020. Secret will face its fair share of hurdles trying to build up a user base, like overcoming users’ general apprehension towards sacrificing convenience over privacy. However, private smart contracts also introduce significant usability advantages and unlock important new use cases. As privacy graduates from a nice-to-have to a necessary feature for users of complex Web3 applications, Secret Network could be one of the sector leaders for private computation.\n\nHere's the link to the full article: [https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network](https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network)", "lang": null, "likes": 9, "replies": 30, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/pkzsyu/new_messari_research_report_on_secret_network/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

The ETH 2.0 people have some magic fairy dust idea, the Cosmos people are grounded in reality that sharding+POS doesn't work, so they got for a Hub-Spoke model (layer-1 single chain, layer 2 spokes), and every other project falls somewhere in between. I have zero idea how POS's security doesn't degrade as a POS attempts to scale up. POS already has massive security problems that sharding exacerbates dramatically  \n\nHowever, ETH is going to be around forever, much like BTC. It's the scaling and the limits of solidity that will hold it back from real \"change\". That doesn't mean it can't be a great showroom for the early phase of defi. Moreover, solidity is just a monster to develop in so when we're talking big money dapps they can't advance too much too fast, it's just not safe.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;LAYER 2 (matic arbitrum etc) \n \nOverall, all layer two solutions have their place but aren't the solution, just a solution that make sense for specific ecosystems and contexts, and not as a general solution to scaling.  \nI doubt if Eth demanded a sidechain for dapps we'd have seen the explosion in innovation that we've seen over teh past 5 years. Moreover, if you use Layer2 solutions, at some point they need to settle through the base layer1 to move funds/etc around to a different layer2 app... you can't really go Layer2-&gt;Layer2 direction, mainnet settlement is needed (layer2-&gt;layer1-&gt;layer2). If Layer1 isn't scalable, then at some point, assuming adoption takes place, layer1 will get congested enough that fees on txs go through the roof.  \n\n\nTHE biggest unsolved problem in crypto for the last decade has been has been: how do we scale layer-1? Specifically, how do you shard/partition layer-1 ledger state. It has been a unsolved problem for so long, and so many BS \"solutions\" have been pitched, that most people have given up on decentralized layer-1 scaling being a solvable problem (and have turned to centralized and/or layer-2 solutions instead.   \n\n---\n\n&gt;POLYGON \n \n5 keys locking 10billion TVL that's INSANE, it's not decentralization that's a rugpull waiting to happen, we're in crypto to eliminate trust, and now we trust billions to 5 people, it's asinine that's what it is.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;ALGORAND  \n\nInteresting tech but terrible tokenomics, almost fully premined and distributed among insiders/team/VCs, smart contract automatically accelerates distribution for \"early backers\", suppressing the price, can't run a node unless you register with the foundation and get approved.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;BSC  \nChain made to be a PnD heaven nothing more, will not exist in a few years  \n\nSupply given to insiders - 50%\n\n\n---\n\n&gt;ZILLIQA  \n\n&gt;TEZOS  \n\nTezos is trying to do things right, good smart contracts... sadly both have an unscalable base layer \n\n---\n\n&gt;FANTOM  \n\n38 Nodes! Nice decentralization guys, do you want to know why they are doing this? it's because all deterministic BFTs performance degrades with consensus node count (this is a fundamental aspect of dbft and thus all \"fast finality\" POS\"). I highly doubt we'll ever see a +200 node POS network with high utilization... POW being probabilistic consensus is a feature that allows for globe spanning trustlessness.\n\nFurthermore, arbitrary DAGs have known performance problems under adoption, they initially have many more execution channels, because transactions are largely unrelated, but as adoption picks up and massive dpps appear on the platform the overall performance decreases because transactions become increasingly related  \n\n---\n\n&gt;AVAX  \n\nAvax mainnet is unsharded. Which means it cannot scale, and again with the DAG.\n\nTheir consensus might be nice but is not battle tested. \n\nIt also seems that Avalanche does not even support cross-subnet transactions at all, right now. They have subnets, but they can't communicate with each other and if they cross-subnet transactions, they are very likely not atomic. Atomic transactions are very important, because it is given by default on unsharded networks and ensures that multiple sub transactions can be combined in one transaction and if one fails all fail.\n  \nBesides that, the subnets are permissioned = centralized control  \n\nSupply given to insiders - 42%\n\n\n\n&gt;ELROND \n \nThe main problem of Elrond is that it doesn't allow for atomic transactions across shards. Meaning if you have dapps which interact with each other (like most DeFi dapps like Uniswap or Aave) you need to deploy them in one shard but this leads to having no scalability (because all interacting dapps are limited by the throughput of one shard), so It's basically useless for anything in defi, it's like going a step backwards from ethereum. \n\n---\n\n&gt;HARMONY  \n\nIt's better described as a layer-1.5 scaling solution if we're being generous. Their problem that the other shards are shoving work onto shard 0 currently (making it slow down because it's processing the bulk of work) is something that isn't possible with a properly scaled layer-1 solution... or at the very least there's a whole new host of economic problems now that shards can fight over doing the least work.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;POLKADOT  \n\nThe problem with Polkadot is that they are more or less a collection of independent blockchains. And transactions between parachains are not atomic. This makes them basically a bunch of isolated islands which are unable to scale. \n\nSupply given to insiders - 35%\n \n&gt;COSMOS  \n\nuses hub-and-spoke, which has the liquidity problem that comes with all layer-2 solutions (you have to de-stake from one peer/spoke, settle to hub, then re-stake to new spoke, to transmit funds... and the hub is low bandwidth so that de-stake is expensive).  \nall in all it's pretty alright despite it, but another problem is that atom is token not needed the coin, maybe it will change with the dex though  \n\nSupply given to insiders - 22%\n\n---\n\n&gt;NEAR  \n\n22 Nodes, Pretty Centralized if you ask me  \n\n---\n\n&gt;IOTA\n\n&gt;ADA\n\nVaporware, I don't care what anyone says, if anything launches then I'll reconsider. (yes radix has it's own little chain with 50tps and no smart contracts, it's not a real project until it releases anything stop spamming)\n\n---\n\n&gt;RADIX\n\nAlso Vaporware, 50tps meme chain with no smart contracts after 7 years of RnD. \n\n---\n\n&gt;SOLANA  \n\nSacrifices decentralization, also the multiplexing of executions take place post consensus, which is effectively Hashgraph. These approaches have the fundamental issue in that, Ahmdal's Law + small world problem basically limit the overall parallelized network throughput to 6x sequential (10x max).  +\n\nSupply given to insiders - 48%\n\n&gt;HBAR  \n\nIt's a corpo coin for institutional use. Its entire setup is for this purpose, the tokenomics, the governance and permissioned nodes are tailored for this purpose of catering to enterprises, or centralized financial use cases.  \nTherefore It will never see the demand that eth or it's competitors are seeing right now, why? because their price is going up because of defi, no one is going to build defi on hbar which means.. no price appreciation.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;MINA\n\n&gt;SAITO\n\nSolutions looking for a problem.\n\n---\n\n\n&gt;FLOW\n\n&gt;SKALE\n\nMORE than 50% of the supply was given to insiders, 58% with flow and 67% with skale. I'm not even going to bother looking into the tech at that point, what a joke\n\n---\n\nThis is peak clown market.\n\n---\n\n\nUnrelated to any specific coin, but the weird bit, which I can't really describe succinctly, is how much a POS system looks like a decentralized Ponzi or MLM. This is mostly because the only way to buy/get tokens is to buy them from people that already bought them vs POW where anyone can mine and capture newly issued tokens (and in equities where a company can sell new stock). It's a loose metaphor that I'm not sure I could convince a regulator of, and yet a defining feature of MLM/Ponzi/POS is that inventory can only be purchased from previous owners. \n\n\nalso unrelated to any coin but Staking and POS is very good for large VCs that want to control what supposed to be a decentralized system... honestly POS degrades into feudalism longterm. Moreover, POW is fundamental to sharding that works... Much like Visa, POS is good for a low throughput, near-instant centralized single chain/settlement layer. POW is good for a high throughput, pretty-fast large decentralized network of chains/settlement layer.  \n\n\nAll that said, the ecosystem is in a weird place right now where decentralization is forgotten in the pursuit of profits and things like binance chain and layer 2 solutions are accepted without much consideration. Blockchains being decentralized is core to resiliency, but decentralization is slower. All in all, I'm a bit concerned that crypto is opening itself up to a black swan event. It could be regulators, it could be a crash that dominos into the staking needs of POS, but being a black swan it's hard to say. its possible for a blackswan in Defi to crash into the consensus layer with POS. Kinda like a market crash taking out a bank in addition to collapsing a market. Not so much with POW because it sandboxes any collapse pretty cleanly in the application layer.", "lang": null, "likes": 55, "replies": 55, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/p9cfnr/the_sad_state_of_smart_contract_protocols/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Crypto currency is a way to store value without human compromise, a way to transfer those value without people's  unfairness. Nevertheless part of transferring value is transferring value between generations known as inheritance (Next of kin), as broken as the current financial system is, they do offer this very part of finance.\nThis might not be a huge problem now, but with time this will become an unavoidable huge problem.\n\nAs speculation have it, Satoshi might be dead, never can tell, but if he is, then his value stored on crypto is lost forever which in a short time means good for crypto value, but how long before everyone holding crypto losses those value due to dead and lost of wallet seed?.\nSharing your wallet seed doesn't cut it, as it will grant your Next of Kin access directly to those value while you are still alive, giving a lawyer compromise the security of those value as it only require your lawyer for those value to be compromised.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\na well secure decentralised finance that doesn't have access to your value, cannot give your Next of Kin access to your value while you are still alive but can securely verify your Next of Kin and help them securely gain access when you are gone. \n\nMore details to be disclosed to programmers and investors who are willing to see this turn a realized project.

One of the key tenets of blockchain decentralization is enabling users to run nodes and verify themselves. Indeed, a blockchain network where users are unable to run full nodes are essentially not trustless, because you're trusting validators/miners. A common misconception is that miners/validators run the networks - it's actually the full nodes. Miners/validators simply provide a service. It's alarming that most blockchain networks do not have a culture of users verifying, and they conveniently sweep this critical flaw under the rug while they boast of \"XXX TPS\". To be clear - there's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's just that these blockchains are not decentralized and not trustless, and should not be compared to those that are. \n\nJameson Lopp has completed a fascinating series of tests on various blockchain full nodes:  [2021 Altcoin Node Sync Tests (lopp.net)](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/). \n\nIt's immediately obvious Bitcoin still takes point when it comes to decentralization. The benchmark is set, with Lopp's reference system taking less than 3 hours to sync 12+ years of Bitcoin. Bitcoin-like networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin also do well. Of course, they do well due to the very limited scalability and utility, but that's the trade-off involved. \n\nMoving on to Ethereum, you can immediately see things get far more challenging. Geth no longer runs on a 1 TB SSD, so Lopp couldn't complete a full sync. But from my experience, it takes about a week to sync. Erigon is Ethereum's fastest client, syncing in two and a half days. It makes some smart choices, which may prove controversial to purists, but I think it's just clever optimization. While that's still far more than Bitcoin, given the amount of utility and scalability Ethereum has provided over 6 years, this is absolutely remarkable. Using the hardware fully, Erigon is a highly optimized client, and perhaps the best in the blockchain industry. \n\nStill, it's obvious that Ethereum is on the very ragged edge of how far L1 scalability can be pushed. Some would argue that it's already way over the limits. People love to complain about high gas fees and such, but actually, this is as good as it's going to get for a decentralized network. \n\nMonero takes nearly as long as Erigon, despite significantly less usage compared to Ethereum over the years. It's still definitely on the edge of being called fully decentralized. \n\nUnfortunately, things start to look very dire as we move on to other protocols. Polkadot and Cardano take 5 hours and 10 hours respectively, which is insane given how little activity these chains have had, with both being live for not more than a year. Once they roll out smart contracts and if they have some real utility and usage on chain, they are going to end up being centralized very rapidly. Granted, both have very poorly written clients, so there's room for optimization to make better use of the hardware. \n\nBinance Smart Chain is the perfect cautionary tale. Despite having meaningful activity for only 6 months or so, it already takes 13 days to sync - which is longer than Ethereum despite forking off Geth. Binance like to boast how they have 8 times the throughput of Ethereum - clearly, it comes at a very steep cost. I estimate within the next year or two it'll be practically impossible to sync on a consumer PC. EOS has already reached there, it takes week/months. \n\nIncredibly, it's already impossible to sync Solana from genesis! Your only option is to get snapshots from Solana Labs. For all intents and purposes, Solana is no longer a decentralized network. On Lopp's high-end consumer PC, he was unable to sync even after getting the snapshot! To be fair, Solana does require 128-256 GB RAM, so this was to be expected. Solana has been live in earnest for 6 months or so, and most of their activity is just Serum (which in turn I suspect is mostly bots and market makers). Already, they have a skip rate of 33%, i.e. 33% of their blocks are not produced on time. How are things going to look years from now? \n\nFinally, we have ICP which flat out don't let you run a full node - you have to buy one of their approved supercomputers. \n\nObviously, this doesn't cover all blockchains, but the general concept holds. The trilemma is real, and the more you push scalability, the harder it gets to run a full node, and the more centralized your network becomes. It's clear that Bitcoin and other Bitcoin-like networks such as Litecoin are the only ones that are unarguably decentralized. Ethereum is at the very edge of this, though Erigon does make things better. Everything is simply not decentralized. \n\nSo, what are the solutions? Geth has implemented fast sync, which doesn't verify all transactions, but downloads the blocks and verifies the proof-of-works. Ethereum's consensus (eth2) clients use weak subjectivity sync to start at a recent block and sync backwards. Techniques like this may be controversial to purists, but to others, they achieve the same results without materially sacrificing decentralization. \n\nWhile the article covers full node syncs, there's another important aspect to it: can a full node stay in sync after the initial sync is complete? For example, with Solana, even using centralized snapshots it was impossible to stay in sync with Lopp's PC. I'd say Binance Smart Chain and presumably Polygon PoS are at the edge of what's possible on a relatively high-end PC today. \n\nA long term solution is stateless clients, where full node clients need not hold and sync the full states - just witnesses. It's a high priority on Ethereum's roadmap, and this will finally make it easy for the average user to run a node. Of course, it won't help full nodes and block proposers, who'll still need to hold the full state, but it'll go a long way in making Ethereum as easy to use (and even more so) as Bitcoin. This will be combined with state expiry, where every year or so inactive state will be expired and archived. Together, statelessness and state expiry will dramatically improve the situation around state size management, which as you can see from the rest of this post is very dire. But obviously, this has its limits and will not help with keeping sync. \n\nSo how do we attain blockchain scalability? The answer is through innovative techniques like rollups and sharding. It's pretty clear a monolithic blockchain will always be highly constrained, no matter what marketing departments claim. This is a whole different can of worms, though, so I'll conclude this post here. \n\nTl;dr: Bitcoin is the only unarguably decentralized network in crypto (and Bitcoin-like networks), and Ethereum is arguably the only other one. We have to hold blockchain projects to a higher standard and force them to use innovative techniques to attain scalability rather than brute force that leads to these networks being inherently centralized.", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 20, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/ow82rx/blockchain_full_nodes_decentralization_and/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.\n\nBoth are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.\n\nDefinition\n\nAPR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nAPY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nWho uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.\n\n&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.\n\nWhat Are They Different?APR\n\nFor example, a yield farming program offers an APR  \nof 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  \n.\n\nOnce you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.\n\nFormular\n\nAPR = r x N\n\nWhere:\n\nr: The interest rate of the year;\n\nN: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).\n\nAPY\n\nAPY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.\n\n&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?\n\nIf you have an APR  \nof 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  \nby 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  \n.\n\nAssuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  \nand APY  \nof these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.\n\nFormular\n\nAPY = (1+r)\\^n - 1\n\nIn which:\n\nr: The interest rate of the period;\n\nn: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).\n\nAwareness\n\nAs such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:\n\n* First, displaying APY  \nwill produce a larger percentage than APR  \n, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.\n* Secondly, the APY  \ninterest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).\n\nToday we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.\n\nRead more [here](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/apy-and-apr-83f)", "lang": null, "likes": 271, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/nnathc/differences_between_apy_apr_in_crypto/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I would appreciate if someone could read and let me know if this already exists or has fundamental flaws.\n\nMy idea is based on a smart contract that would have access to and protect private info as well as manage public info. Private info: Combination of identifiers like biometrics (thumb print)/IP address/device identifier (e.g. mac address) associated with a wallet. Public info: wallet address and wallet credit score.\n\nOperation: A user can build credit through submitting the private info to the contract and taking out small loans that are partially/wholly collateralized with a relatively high rate of interest. Upon repayment, the smart contract registers a higher credit score associated with the wallet. If unpaid, the credit score decreases. Below some threshold score, the user can no longer take out loans. The small size of initial loans and combination of identifiers required would make it infeasible for a bot to attack the system by taking out many small loans and not repaying. Perhaps the protocol could start out with some staked/pooled funds to cover initial losses and encourage lending. As a borrower's credit increases, they would be allowed to use less collateral and pay lower interest rates. Ideally this could solve the issue in DeFi of loans needing to be overcollateralized.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

This functionality will be available cross-chain through Chainlink. How do they? Source: [https://blog.ltonetwork.com/understanding\\_did/](https://blog.ltonetwork.com/understanding_did/) (credit to [Mickey Maler](https://blog.ltonetwork.com/author/mickey/))\n\n**What DID is:**\n\nA Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a new type of identifier that is:\n\n* globally unique\n* resolvable with high availability\n* cryptographically verifiable\n* issued for a lifetime (unless revoked by the owner)\n\nDIDs are typically associated with cryptographic material, such as public keys, and service endpoints, for establishing secure communication channels. DIDs are useful for any application that benefits from self-administered, cryptographically verifiable identifiers, such as personal identifiers, organizational identifiers, and identifiers for Internet-of-Things scenarios.  \n\n\nThe same way the [*SSL/TLS protocol*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) changed internet use forever by opening a gate to the world of encrypted Web traffic, which is the basis for the protocol that keeps the web safe and secure HTTPS; the same way will DIDs enhance the verification process in world of blockchain, such as decentralized finance.  \n \n\n**The DID is a new standard of representing users’ identities by referencing subjects in a decentralized way. It is an identifier that references a subject such as:**\n\n* a person\n* an organization\n* an object\n\n**The use cases for DIDs include:**\n\n* Identifying people, organizations, and things\n* Achieving a number of security and privacy-protecting guarantees\n\nDIDs are unique identifiers that specify a resolution method for a DID and a blockchain address that represent its owner. \n\n**Example:**  \n   \nLTO's Lead Architect's DID stored on LTO Network would have DID [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (a pointer) set like is: \n\n***did****:****lto****:****3JuijVbbserasr48h8rz8451RTyeL***\n\nThe format of this is: ***scheme****:* ***the method used****:* ***user's pseudonymous ID***  \n \n\nThe example DID above resolves by DID Controller to a DID document, the minimal example of which you can see below:  \n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n {\n\n***// context explicitly defines the subject - i this case, DID***\n\n\"@context\": \"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\",\n\n\"id\": \"did:lto:3JuijVBB7Nrasr48h8rz8451RTyeL\",\n\n\"authentication\": \\[{\n\n ***// used to authenticate as did***\n\n  \"id\": \"did:lto:3JuijVbbserasr2Ea5hCDz8451RTyeL#keys-1\",\n\n  \"type\": \"Ed25519VerificationKey2020\",\n\n ***// A DID Controller is an entity that has the capability to make changes to a DID document***\n\n  \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n  \"publicKeyMultibase\": \"zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV\"\n\n}\\]\n\n}  \n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe DID document contains associated cryptographic information (like public keys) that allows the DID controller to prove they are/own the subject. This is possible thanks to the fact that every identifier is signed with a user private key. The public key, uniquely paired with the private key, is then published to a distributed ledger.\n\nWhen a DID is resolved, the extracted public key is compared to the public key stored on a blockchain. A DID document is something like a “blockchain hand-shake” between the information stored in the DID and on a blockchain.  \n\n\nFor a proper functionality of DIDs on the LTO network, any DID must be indexed first. Indexing is a process that connects the public address with the associated public key. An address owner can do so using a simple anchoring transaction that will ensure their DID is properly indexed.\n\nThis is caused by the fact that the blockchain address is generated from the public key using a one-way hashing function, which makes it impossible to extract the public key from an address.\n\nWithout the anchoring transaction, the public key for an address remains unknown.\n\n**Unification with a real-world identity**\n\nCombination of DID with a proof of identity, which was issued by some authority, enhances the DID capabilities. DID can be part of Verifiable credentials (VC), which acts as digital certificates, ID, diplomas, or many others. This way, it is possible to verify the identities of persons or objects, and also, it is possible to add a value to these objects. Using a VC with DIDs that contains information about several real estate properties, can act  as proof of ownership and value for these objects.  \nCombining DID with VC keeps the user credentials private.  \n \n\nCombination of DID with a certificate issued by a Certificate authority (CA) creates a great tool for companies that want to cooperate in trust networks and their identity is claimed by the certificate issued by CA.  \nCombining DID with an CA issued certificate (type x509) keeps the company credentials public, this saving time with manual searching for the company credibility.\n\n**Summarization**\n\nDIDs enable you to reference subjects in a decentralized way. DIDs can be resolved to DID documents. DID documents allow the controller to prove they are/own the subject. LTO Network generates these documents for all LTO accounts, which have done at least one TX. These accounts are created by publishing a certificate which is related to a DID, thus making a connection between the DID and real-world identity. DIDs can be part of Verifiable credentials (VC) .  \n \n\n**Additional suggested reading:**\n\n* [DID for DeFi?

This post shows not only how btc/LN can participate in defi cheaply, but it can also act as a bridge between all chains.\n\nThere are many ETH compatible blockchains that provide the same utility as ETH, though with less security (matters only for large amounts), less decentralization, and questionable long term value due to insider allocations and associated future selling pressure.\n\nAn alternative to a mint/burn bridge is, to use a defi analogy, a single asset liquidity pool on one (destination) chain with a transfer dapp on source chain.  2 simple things can happen on destination chain.  Either LP shares are minted and given to transferrer, or \"cash\"/tokens is taken out of the pool and given to transferrer on the destination chain.  Liquidity fees are accrued to LP share holders,based on the depth of the pool.\n\nThe tokens on the transferrer side can be managed on whichever chain is cheapest.  By managed, I mean the simplest transfer transaction happens to be LP shares that are tracked on one chain, but represent a share of value on the transferring chain.\n\nFor ERC compatible chains the benefit of this may be minimal, but Polygon to ETH is extremely expensive bridge, and these may be simpler contracts.\n\nBut the main point of this post is bridging to LN/bitcoin.  Bitcoin holders may want to access utility of smart contract platform including stablecoins, and as part of swap, create a LN channel with an entity that has interest in both LN/btc and the utility chain.  A LN channel has 3 assets of value for each party.  A btc balance, outgoing capacity, and incoming capacity.\n\nThe scheme requires a federation of utility token holders that are willing to trade outgoing LN capacity creation for utility tokens.  Federation members must maintain a web of LN channels with each other.  Utility token LP holders (single asset \"liquidity pool\") need to independently from their LP investment buy LN outgoing capacity from a federation member up to their highest imaginable proceeds from their utility token trade.  Trade price is set by oracles  LP holders receive fees for providing liquidity to market price.  A LN buyer of utility token will have created outbound liquidity to a Federation member.  His buy order is an LN transaction contingent upon the federation member triggering the Utility chain's dapp and routing the bitcoin purchase to LP holders on their LN channels, The triggered dapp releases the utility tokens from the LP pool to the LN buyer.  These conditional payment chains are already part of LN technology.\n\nThis process attached to multiple chains, easily extends to using LN as a bridge between all chains without needing a 1:1 burn/mint bridge, may be cheaper fees than atomic exchange 3rd party facilitators, and bridges incompatible chains.\n\nThe LN channels can be as permanent as the users want.  It simplifies trading back and forth into bitcoin and any native utility token at lower fees than WETH or WBTC.  It expands LN adoption.  Benefits utility chains as they can expect more value to come to them than leak out to bitcoin.  Adds small and frequent payment utility to bitcoin holders, and more LN adoption means more LN merchants, CEX onramps.\n\nHeadline a bit misleading, could be LN as DEFI onramp platform:  Access to what bitcoin or LN can't do.", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/mqgjwa/lightning_network_as_defi_platform_minimum_viable/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I think the bad blood which formed as a result, between those in the crypto space broadly and the IF/community, is partly why there haven't been many (non-IOTA related) experts take a look at the IF's re-imagination around how a feeless, scalable DLT could work.\n\nTo me their approach looks interesting and I'd be keen to hear how others think about it and where there may be holes in the theory (well I say theory, but there is already a testnet built with many of the components).\n\n[A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PK97KSpcI) from a few days ago is probably one of the most complete descriptions I have seen on how this new approach comes together (with the removal of the coordinator). One of the community members put together a [comprehensive set of notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IiTslHmhHim4Hkbrc7RlSmnCwsAwXUc/view) for this video (specifically of interest are sections D &amp; E from page 3 onward), which is perhaps more easily consumed, with some of it quoted below.\n\n**What they needed to come up with:**\n\n&gt;Serguei used to say we could not have a leader-based consensus mechanism, so we had to brainstorm options.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(a) A leader-based consensus protocol (BTC, for instance): there is a race to solve the cryptographic puzzle and gain the right to write to the ledger. That brings a reward, so all the nodes compete. This is something sequential, with a total order. For each block the right goes to just one miner. We wanted something more dynamic and something that might enable endless scalability.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(b) The Sybil protection mechanism they use with total-ordering ledger structure does not allow scalability.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, we started with two objectives: feeless and scalable. And that is how we came up with the idea of Mana.\n\n1. You have to think of how this could enable a more flexible network structure. The biggest problem in cryptocurrencies is that the power becomes centralized to a small number of nodes. It happens quite naturally.\n2. With mana we want to build a more complex reputation system. We want a flexible way to reward small nodes to somehow reduce the Power Law distribution where a few large nodes get too much power. This system gives us the flexibility and a countermeasure to favor good-behaving nodes and penalize bad-behaving nodes.\n\n**Leaderless architecture / parallelized transactions:**\n\n&gt;Bitcoin and Ethereum and other delegated-proof-of-stake blockchains are leader based. A leader gets elected (a specific miner or validator) that creates a new block, publishes it to the network, and then the network reaches consensus. Transaction security increases the more blocks get appended.\n\n1. That is how blockchain works today, and nearly all of the protocols ahead of us on CMC work.\n2. With IOTA, being based on a Directed Acyclic Graph, we no longer want to elect a leader, because that imposes a limit. We want to parallelize the transactions that happen and that can be confirmed.\n3. What makes IOTA so unique is we no longer have serialized consensus, but parallelized: transactions from thousands of IoT devices and people happen at the same time and the Tangle is able to scale and confirm these transactions simultaneously.\n4. One of the most important properties of IOTA is feeless transactions. One of the most difficult parts of a blockchain is the Sybil protection mechanism: how do we ensure someone does not spend infinite transactions to attack the network and double spend? Mana and rate control are our answer to prevent these attacks.\n\n&gt;Different parameters can be optimized for specific use cases, and you end up with very different architectures. For example, Solana can do tens of thousands of transactions per second, but for a very different use case than for IOTA, and it requires very specialized nodes with highly-spec’d out hardware can join their network.\n\n**Fundamental principles of the network:**\n\n&gt;Many times Bitcoin thought they had easy fixes for new applications, or to prevent certain problems, but they always mitigated with fees or other filters. With IOTA we do not want to impose any sort of fees, so we had to start with fundamental principles, for requirements to solve:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fairness, Consistency, Efficiency, and Security. These are well-known needs of networks, such as in Telecom.\n\n1. Fairness: share network access proportionally to reputation\n2. Consistency: all nodes eventually receive the same messages\n3. Efficiency: adapt resources to changing network conditions\n4. Security: attackers cannot affect any of the above requirements\n\n&gt;Consistency actually poses the biggest challenge. It is not a challenge in a standard network, but in a DLT we have a message we are trying to deliver to all nodes. If the transactions are not successfully delivered to practically all nodes it is not possible to reach full consensus. I cannot participate in a vote if I don’t know a transaction exists, or I might start building on a transaction that others do not see.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On top of all this we require complete security.\n\n**On Mana:**\n\n&gt;Mana: We need a way to decide who can have access and who can decide on transactions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a. In order to prevent a Sybil attack, we need to verify access to a scarce resource. In Bitcoin the scarce resource is hashing power. In other protocols the scarce resource is staked tokens.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b. We wanted an approach that rewarded nodes depending on the work they are doing. When a transaction is issued there is some mana created, proportional to the number of tokens being shared. The transaction can decide to which node to pledge the mana (most of the time it would just reward the node that is doing the work, since it did the work of signing the transaction, etc. but we have the possibility of rewarding a different node). Without this an attacker could create infinite identities to participate in a voting mechanism, or could create nodes to send transactions at an infinite rate without any control. We need a way to split the cake between participants.\n\n**Mana as spectrum / for rate control :**\n\n&gt;Mana draws a perfect comparison to the frequency spectrum. We have a limited spectrum that we divide between TV, radio, the military, etc. We think about we distribute this limited resource. The winners of the Nobel Prize in economics this year won for their solution of “spectrum auctions.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a. Fairness, consistency, efficiency, and security also apply to spectrum auctions. We are applying similar principles from past protocols (like Telecom) and adapting them to this new decentralized world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b. Mana is an auction mechanism. You hold iota tokens, which makes you a participant in the network and in the auction because you can generate mana.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;c. Mana is the rate control that determines how the scarce resource (transaction throughput) should be distributed according to the requirements of fairness, consistency, efficiency, and security.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;d. This is the first time that we have a completely new congestion control mechanism, not tried by any other DLT. Mana is one of the most exciting concepts of Coordicide: it proves that IOTA is evolving from just being a cryptocurrency to being a real piece of technology.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The flexibility that gives us mana is amazing. I can rent my mana, for example. It makes IOTA extremely different.\n\nAnyway, these are just some of the parts which stood out to me as exciting and quite different to most other cryptocurrency projects.\n\nI would be curious to hear the thoughts of those in this sub as a long time reader (first time poster, I think?).\n\n**\\[Addendum\\]** A few have suggested the above is buzzword heavy or a word salad, which may be my fault for quoting those bits I found most relevant for putting together the final pieces in my head. You could watch the video linked above, instead of reading the cliff notes, or there is more about Mana in these posts from the IF and those with the capability could review the implementation in the post coordicide testnet:\n\n[https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-6f636690b916/](https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-6f636690b916/)\n\n[https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-part-2/](https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-part-2/)\n\n[https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer)", "lang": null, "likes": 40, "replies": 45, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/m9sli5/iotas_novel_approach_to_consensus_parallelized/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

With the creation of smart contracts  it became much easier to program blockchains to do much more. As a result a huge number of decentralised apps have been born out of the Ethereum ecosystem. When Ethereum and solidity were first created the goal was to create a 'world computer', a Turing complete decentralised network that was flexible enough to allow pretty much anything to be coded on it. This was an ambitious view and from the perspective of the developers at the time would open up countless possibilities of things that could be decentralised in the future. At the time, nobody knew what the future of cryptocurrency would be like and people didn't know that Defi would become what it is now.\n\nUsually there is a trade off when building something for general purposes vs building something for specific purposes. General purpose solutions are broad in their scope and usually perform specific tasks worse than a solution which is specifically built for that task. This is one of the disadvantages of the \"world computer\" model\n\n**How are Turing machines and Finite state machines relevant to Smart Contracts?**\n\nIf a computer is Turing complete then theoretically it could simulate anything, the caveat being that this is true given enough time. Some simulations could take longer than the lifespan of the universe to complete but theoretically the computer will eventually be able to simulate them. Solidity is a Turing complete language.\n\nWhile a language like solidity allows for a large degree of flexibility and possibilities, coding smart contracts on solidity can get complex and there is less specificity. By providing the ability to code anything there are also more possible ways the code can go wrong.\n\nFinite state machines (FSMs) are a class of machines that have a finite number of possible states and can only be in one of these possible states at any point in time (hence the name). A finite state machine is more restricted than a Turing machine. There are things that can be coded in a Turing machine that cannot be coded in a Finite State machine however the advantage being that the limited number of states mean that each set of inputs has a specific set of outputs it can produce. \n\nWhile Turing complete machines have an infinite number of states a program can be in, which grants them their flexibility. A large number of these states  are \"error\" states, and because the possible number of states are infinite it is hard to avoid errors when programming apps. A finite state machine limits the number of \"error\" states so they are much easier to find and there is a lower probability of encountering one.\n\nThe advantage this provides is greater predictability and simplicity. By reducing the amount of possibilities coding becomes more simple, faster and less prone to things going wrong.\n\n**How does this relate to smart contract exploits?**\n\nBased on the above, the Turing completeness of solidity and Ethereum has created some risk factors when coding apps for DeFi. The flexibility and infinite states solidity provides make it incredibly difficult for developers to avoid error states for certain, this issue is magnified when multiple DeFi apps are combined together.\n\nThis is evident by the large amount of exploits and hacks in DeFi smart contracts recently leading to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of losses. \n\n**How Radix addresses exploits and hacks**\n\nRadix was built specifically to cater to the needs of DeFi, the developers were aware of the issues with security in DeFi along with many others. To minimise the exploit problem, instead of using a Turing complete language. Radix uses Scrypto, its own FSM language which will allow easier and safer deployment of financial apps, based on the advantages described above. By using a FSM language the probability of unexpected exploits caused by \"error\" states on Radix is greatly reduced, and because the possibilities are finite it is much easier to check what could go wrong in a contract and prevent it.\n\n**The Radix component catalogue**\n\nThe input-output structure of FSMs like Scrypto allows components to be built on Radix. Components are pieces of code with a specific function that can be reused by app developers for example a token minting component, a liquidity pool component or a token swapping component. These components can be used as building blocks by app developers to save time. Instead of writing code from scratch for specific actions they can just use a trusted pre-existing component to both save time and reduce fears of coding errors. \n\nOne last benefit of this component catalogue which is unrelated to security is the royalty system. Radix has a royalty system in place to reward developers for building good and useful components. When a component is built and added to the catalogue the creator of it receives royalties every single time it is used, incentivising developers to build on Radix by providing them an opportunity to earn royalties for life thus fuelling the growth of the Radix ecosystem.\n\n**But doesn't using a FSM limit the use cases of Radix?**\n\nDifferent FSMs have different levels of complexity, a traffic light system is a simple example of a FSM. A self driving car system is a more complex FSM. Radix has enough flexibility and complexity to be used for a wide range of financial,  and other application use cases. Almost all use cases of crypto that currently exist today (NFTs, DEX's, token minting etc) will all be possible to code on Radix. The FSM environment is flexible enough to support the main relevant use cases of crypto while still providing security and ease of coding. As a proof of concept a decentralised twitter is even being built as a demo on a proof of concept version of Radix.\n\nTo paraphrase the words of founder Dan Hughes \"you could code a flight simulator on Ethereum but not on Radix\" For most use cases of DLT technology Radix will be suitable, there may be a few niches in the future it isn't suited to but there is more than enough value in the markets and use cases it does cover.", "lang": null, "likes": 33, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/lw1mrh/preventing_smart_contract_exploits_on_radix/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

It’s finally back.\n\nPrivacy has always been in the spirit of NavCoin. Our old nomenclature, NavajoCoin, was a homage to the American Navajo tribe of code talkers, who played a crucial role assisting the Marines during the WWII. Their performance excelled that of the existing code-breaking machines at the time. We wanted to translate that excellence into a cryptocurrency, as we rapidly saw the unsuitability of public blockchains when securing the access to our own financial data. Our goal was to create a value-transfer system which protected the privacy of its users.\n\nBack in 2016, we presented the innovative NavTech, our first privacy solution. Users were able to operate their own mixing nodes, making them collect fees from transactions while providing liquidity for others to shuffle their coins with. Since the release of NavTech, we aimed to improve the system we designed. We sat down and started to research how we could refine it.\n\nThere were mainly two weak points in our previous protocol. NavTech appealed to the use of denominations (breaking a whole amount in different multiples) in order to obfuscate the value transacted. While hard to reconstruct the exact amount for a human observer, it was proven that the use of mathematical heuristics could help to link the two sides of a transaction by establishing connections based on how the amounts were split.\n\nA second weak point was the fact that NavTech required trust in the individuals who acted as operators of the mixing nodes. This did not align with our purpose of building trustless decentralised technologies.\n\n2020 just came to an end. It took us 4 years to bring to fruition a substitute for NavTech. Our new privacy proposal, xNAV, solves the aforementioned issues and opens new exciting doors for the future of NavCoin.\n\nThanks to blsCT, our novel self-developed cryptographic protocol, not only amounts are now obfuscated in a way that observers can’t elucidate the value transacted, but also both the sender and receiver of a transaction. The new private token xNAV and its mixing protocol built on top of blsCT, make the whole network of NavCoin nodes operate as an indestructible decentralized mixing network with no trust involved. This is a major improvement compared to NavTech.\n\nThe additional scalability advances result of the aggregation capabilities of BLS signatures and the support for scripting and smart contracts make us very excited about the potential of xNAV. A whole range of applications will be able to profit from its privacy enhancing features. We are looking forward to see NAV and xNAV integrated in some of the most exciting DeFi tools.\n\nRead more [here](https://medium.com/nav-coin/the-future-of-nav-as-a-privacy-coin-starts-today-76d329ac818a).", "lang": null, "likes": 13, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/kq6xph/the_future_of_nav_as_a_privacy_coin_starts_today/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I posted it other places and generally got the misconception that this is about e-voting. It isn't. I am not attempting to solve any problems of e-voting.\n\nThe idea is to link time with an opinion, to curate content, or make decisions collectively. It's a baseline skeleton for building fair collaborative systems.\n\nAlso the biometric part is purely optional!!! I don't plan to use it in my own Web 4 apps. It's like a fun bonus idea, and I may remove it from the final draft.\n\nAll Love,\n\n- Douglas\n\nP.S. Going out to eat Tacos now, will reply when I get home!! \n\n\n# The Web 4 Manifesto: Awakening the Democratic Web \n\nWeb 4 is a set of four **modular paradigms** (time tokens, biokeys, information entropy, and geo-social systems) that allow integration of **provable democracy in any social system** that seeks to be more collaborative (organization, government, community, etc.). Modularity allows any project to adopt one or more of these principles to **increase the accuracy, fairness, and transparency** of each individual's role in **collaboration**. \n\nWeb 4 is **built on top of web 3** (it's blockchain-based) while being **fundamentally different** and providing enough **benefit to society** warrant the new title of web 4. \n\nIn essence, web 4 is **collaboration consensus tool** that helps to manifest a shared desire, opinion, or solution by providing a fair system of accounting using time-limited votes, real people, and existing geopolitical stratification.\n\n&gt; Web 4 combines real-world components like time and geography with existing blockchain technology.\n\nIn this manifesto, I will define each of the **components** of web 4, provide **psudeocode** to illustrate the minimum integration into web 2/3, introduce the **benefits to society**, and offer a **roadmap** to adopting these concepts.\n\n# The Problem\nDemocracy, society's biggest and most successful consensus and collaboration mechanism, has become **too slow to keep up** with the modern world. Groups of people organizing, whether to turn a profit as a company, or to live together in a city, are often **under-, mis-, or not represented at all** in the decision making processes that affect their lives and work. In both governments and companies it is the few that make the decisions for the many, even with the **illusion** of \"having a say\" that exists in a **representative system**. \n\n# The Solution\nBy providing each individual with **equal power** in a **transparent decision making process**, the true intent of the majority can not only be known, it can be acted upon in predetermined ways through smart contracts. Though this solution seems simple, there are issues that will need to be addressed according to the needs of each group of collaborating people, such as ensuring **one person per account**, and **limiting the minting of voting tokens with time**, as well as protecting the **privacy of decision makers** where appropriate. This paper will detail these solutions, and recommend that each system decide what components of web 4 to use or not use. For example, systems can (and should) be built using time tokens that **do not use biometric data at all**, a common concern in our modern world. \n\n\n# Background\n\nBefore we detail web 4, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1, web 2, and web 3. \n\n - **Web 1**\n**Static web**. Files are served from a remote server to a user's browser.\n\n - **Web 2**\n**Dynamic web**. Web pages take a user's information and desires into account to build a unique experience for them. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central server.\n\n - **Web 3**\n**Decentralized web**. Applications, often open-source, exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and autonomy. \n\n - **Web 4**\n**Democratic web**. Time-limited tokens are given to each individual, and used as a measure of opinion or desire in collaborative systems.\n\nToday, the top 100 websites/apps by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2-based. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of **corporate-owned information.** \n\nAs more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of **government, censorship, centralization and federated power**, web 3 has emerged as a powerful, provable option to shape the evolution of information and society on planet Earth. \n\nA growing portion of web 2 websites and applications today have elements of web 3, like [cryptoblogs](https://peakd.com) and [games](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games). While web 2 and web 3 can operate independently, web 3 enhances the abilities of web 2. Similarly, web 3 and web 4 can operate independently, but it makes the most sense for web 4 to be built on blockchains to gain the benefits of reliability and transparency. \n\n## Guiding Philosophy\nWeb 4 seeks to implement [biomimetic](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/) systems in **harmony with the universe itself** by replicating nature: the **abundance** of the Sun, rising **entropy**, and the **equality** of each human being. \n\nWeb 4 tests the hypothesis that when we create information systems in **harmonic resonance** with natural systems, our society will be able to advance more rapidly than ever before, as we will be able to **synchronize energetically** with the larger systems of bioelectromagnetic information processing around us (the Earth, Sun, and Galactic core). \n\n\n## Defining Web 4\nWeb 4 introduces **four modular components** for **provably democratic systems**, suggested to be built on top of web 3's open-source decentralized networks. \n\n### There are four conceptual underpinnings (modules) of web 4\n\n 1. **Time Tokens** \n\t Individuals may claim time-limited tokens at given intervals, which represent that interval. Only one time tokens can represent the one interval and individual, and one individuals can't hold another's time tokens.\n 2. **Proof of Individuality (One Person, One Account)**\n\t Biometric Secrets, Social Verification, Proof of Liveness, white lists, etc. are used to guarantee no individual can collect two time tokens for a given interval by holding two accounts. \n 3. **Information Entropy**\n\t Information degradation over time, pseudo accounts in sensitive systems\n 4. **Harmonic Geo-social Systems**\n\t Fair, transparent collaboration through accounting the opinions and desires of participants, including in existing geopolitical \n\nEach module can be used separately or in tandem. This paper invites you to involve any of these ideas into your current and future projects. We will discuss these concepts one at a time, but first let's examine why we need them in the first place. \n\n\n# Why we must grow from web 3 to evolve democracy\n&gt; Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3 as-is because there is no inherit limit over how many accounts a user may control.\n\n**Democracy** is essentially reaching a consensus with the idea that **each person is equal** in their influence on that consensus within defined bounds.\n\nMany different **consensus models** have been developed in web 3, most notably, [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work) (**POW**), [proof of stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake) (**POS**), and [delegated proof of stake ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/delegated-proof-of-stake-explained)(**DPOS**). These paradigms of consensus are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction records (blocks) is considered valid, \"securing\" a blockchain. \n\nPOS and DPOS are additionally used in projects like [**Hive**](https://peakd.com) to allow users to \"vote\" on valuable content, an early example of the democratic web. DPOS is also used for networks to determine who can access network resources, such as in [EOSIO blockchains](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md).\n\nHowever, both of these POS/DPOS use cases (curation and resource allocation) are not democratic in the sense that **each account is not equal**. In both cases, the root of democracy is in the token, not the individual, and the ownership of tokens determines the voting power or computing power held by an individual. \n\nIn the end, the only way to implement true democracy in any system is through giving **each individual equal power**. The only way to do this while keeping web 3's decentralized nature is to implement the technological and idealogical advancements needed for a **one individual,  one account** system. These advancements  are, for simplicity and communication, called web 4. \n\nLet's review the concepts one by one.\n\n___\n# **1**\n\n___\n\n# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) \n\nTime tokens may be offered or directly distributed to users' wallets periodically. They work by hashing a unique personal identifier (address) with a time identifier, **linking each token to a person and a span of time**.\n\n\n## The Gears of Time Tokens\n\nTime tokens rely on the following concepts:\n 1. **Time Tokens** \n\t Individuals may claim time-limited tokens at given intervals, which represent that interval. Only **one time token can represent the one interval and individual**, and one individual can't hold another's time tokens.\n\t These tokens provide the user with a function or action. The action burns the token, which may cause some change in the state of a system, such as minting another token, registering a vote, or any other action. Thus, **each time token is unique yet semi-fungible**. Time tokens can also be checked for freshness when needed, for example a user may have to use a certain time period's token to cast a vote in an election, which SHOULD also exclude that particular time token from all other functions. \n\t \n 2. **Time Unit**\nA time unit is an time interval that is a sub- or superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of seconds. Each time token MUST be the only one in existence stamped with a particular time unit for each user (wallet). \n\n 2. **Time Faucet**\nA time faucet is a smart contract that offers any qualified account EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user. \n\n 3. **Qualified Accounts**\nQualified accounts adhere to the individuality requirements of a given system. Each web 4 system will do this differently according to their needs, perhaps with a whitelist, social verification, biometric verification, proof of liveness, or other means. \n\n\n## How do Time Tokens work?\nTime tokens operate like non-fungible tokens in their structure, storing a time unit (integer) with a unique user identifier (string) as the payload data. \n\nThe user's identifier may also be a biocryptographic key (biokey) discussed in the next section.\n\nTime tokens are platform independent, and need only the ability to store simple data: a time unit and user identifier. \n\nIn practice, a time unit is an integer that counts up the number of pre-defined time spans that have passed since an **epoch**. The epoch is typically when the system went live, and represents 0 in the first time interval. \n\n## Time Tokens in practice\n\nIf we were to create a time token for a US citizen to vote in the **US presidential election**, the time span would be 126144000 seconds (four years), and the epoch would be at a timestamp representing the start of the **election day previous to the first election** to use time tokens. On election day, an active faucet would send one time token to each registered voter (aka Qualified Account) with a payload of the user's **unique identifier and the integer 1 as the time unit** (the next election would be 2, and so on.) The user would then send the token to the election's smart contract address with a **memo of their vote**. The system would check the identity of the voter, validity of the memo, and the time unit against their list to ensure they are voting in the correct election, **burn the token** (or else reverse the transaction if malformed), and send the user back another token representing a **\"I Voted\" sticker**. \n\n&gt; This example intentionally doesn't account for anonymity\n\n**This example is trivial.** It becomes beneficial when we realize that we can just as easily send the person 12 voting tokens so they can vote on their first, second and third choice. It becomes even more interesting when we send tokens **every month** (or so) and allow the people to **vote directly on the bills that are being presented to their respective legislative bodies**. It becomes even more expansive when we have the faucet smart contract require **educational actions**, such as opening a link to information on these bills (summary and the full text) **to receive their time tokens**. \n\n## A Simple Example in web 2\n\nHere is the minimum information stored in a time token, using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/) as an example\n```\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n  },\n  \"payoadData\": {\n    \"time-unit\": 294957,\n    \"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\"\n  }\n}\n```\nBelow is a brief pseudocode example of how one could use a signed time token as a JWT.\n\nSee Appendix A for more detailed pseudocode of a time token. \n```\nconst passedBioData = {..} // biodata from user\n\nconst header = {\n        \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n        \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n      }\n\nconst payloadData = {\n\t\"time-unit\": \"294957\", \n\t\"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\", \n\t\"appData\": {\n\t\t\"gold\": 479,\n\t\t\"honey\": 23,\n\t\t\"axe\": 0 \n\t}\n}\n\nconst bioKey = bioKeyGenerator(passedBioData); // Biometric provider's key or one generated direcly by user\n\n// --- Here we have the signature, to be used for any purpose --- \\\\\nsignature = HMACSHA256(\n\tbase64UrlEncode(header) + \".\"+\n\tbase64UrlEncode(payloadData), \n\tbioKey\n)\n\n\nfunction bioKeyGenerator(bioData){\n\t// Function takes data in the form of user input into their browser or smartphone.\n\t// Data is normalized (explained in Appendix A, not shown here)\n\tbioKeyChecked = bioData;\n\t// Return biokey \n\treturn sha256(bioKeyChecked)\n}\n\n\n```\nThe notable parts here are the `time-unit` and `userid` in the payload, and the `bioKey` which is generated by a user's biometric data.\n\nWe have said we web 4 is based on web 3 (blockchain), but this example intentionally used  **web 2 technology**. Much of the rest of this paper goes over ways to avoid trust by incorporating biometric data in a specific way, but that's not always needed, or helpful. We have to trust a government to run our elections. We have to trust social media platforms with our photos. We have to trust the Sun will rise, and a. giant meteor won't crash into Earth. \n\nThe truth is, **all systems have some level of trust**, even if that's just in the system itself. If we try to get rid of this trust by implementing a system so good we are our own private key, it can backfire, and when it does, if we built it because we were fearful instead of trusting, that's super lame. \n\nWhile I'm going to lay out a possible solution to use biometrics in a \"trustless\" way that fits with web 3 ideals, I don't personally think it's a good idea, and I won't be designing my Web 4 apps with it for quite some times, if ever. \n\n___\n# **2**\n\n___\n\n# **Proof of Individuality - Biokeys + Biosecrets**\n&gt; **Please Note:** There are solutions available today (like [FaceTec](https://www.facetec.com/) and [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/)) that solve the same issues presented here. This paper seeks to outline a web 3-based system (decentralized + open source) that can run without a centralized actor, while not providing specifics to accomplish these goals. This is more of a thought experiment than a suggestion or requirement. \n\n**Biometric secrets (biosecrets)** are akin to any cryptographic private key, but they are your actual biological data, or, more specifically, a four dimensional expression of your humanness from which biometric data is collected. \n\nInstead of a private key generated alongside a public key, **a hash of quantized biometric data becomes your public key**, which is paired with your **actual flesh-and-blood-and-sound-and-movement-data, your private/secret key**, or as we call it \"**biosecret**\" which isn't stored on any server or blockchain. \n\n## Keys  \n1. **Biosecret**: A biosecret is a specific biometric expression that is quantized using cartesian grids into data points with a precision that makes it replicable for the individual in the future, but impossible for another person to duplicate, even an identical twin.\n\n2. **Biokey**: The biometric information that makes up a biosecret is hashed into a public biokey, making the original biometrics practically impossible to reconstruct for a biokey.\n\n\n\n## How this can go wrong\nIn today's biometric space, static images are most commonly used for things like fingerprint and facial recognition, and geometry is the means to compare this data. Biometric secrets generated from static images are not secure, as static images can be faked. [2] Video offers a better solution to this problem, as it is harder to fake, can include audio, and lets developers create a whole new set of algorithms based on a changing stream of data. [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/) is one company using video for biometric verification. \n\n\n## What could be used to generate a biokey?\nThis stream of data (video + audio biometric expression) could be a user doing a series of hand gestures, singing a part of a song, speaking a phrase, speaking a phrase in different voices, clapping, making a series of facial expressions or movements, or anything else one can imagine.\n\nFor security, biometric expressions (used to make a biokey) must be unique (for example, which combination of words to speak) and many types must be available (gestures, movement, singing, clapping, etc) and used in combination. **If each person's biokey was generated from the same single biometric expression, it would be a matter of time before specific AI could be developed to deepfake it for anyone**. If the user is the only one that knows their biometric expressions it becomes nearly impossible to guess the type and nature of the expression, and even if that is known, difficult to use the same technique on more than one account. The nature of the uniqueness could be chosen by the user, or generated at random from the biokey software which would prompt the user to complete an action in a specific way. \n\n## Why do we need this, again?\nDemocratic systems certainly are being built without biometric verification, and will continue to be even after suitable biometric technology develops along the open source, client-side requirements. For now, **decentralized solutions** like [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), and centralized tech like [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/FaceTec_3D_Face_Matching_Whitepaper.pdf) provide the necessary individuality at the cost of trust and requirement of citizenship. Additionally, **biometric data can be avoided entirely** by using a social verification platform like [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) As different projects implement web 4 in their own ways, the ideas presented thus far will develop as flaws are found. And there's always the ability to use a whitelist, the most low-tech, high-trust, and simplest solution.\n\n## Trust Issues\nThe biggest issue with biometrics is the lack of trust the general population has (or should have) with giving up their biometric data, including the growing number of facial recognition softwares and databases. The lack of trust is almost always associated with an individual's **lack of clear consent**, and lack of understanding the technology itself. \n\n### To alleviate the trust issue, biokey generators must be: \n1) **open-source**\n2) entirely run on the individual's hardware (**client-side**), and \n3) **not expose any biometric data** to any other users or to a web 4 system itself (the biosecret is never stored or transmitted in any way). \n\nThere will always be **security concerns** with biometrics. For example, if a user uses their biometric secret to unlock their mobile device, another app could be secretly recording the camera in the background. A person could record them doing their secret, and try to play that video back to the camera to gain access. Also, *[deepfakes](https://github.com/aerophile/awesome-deepfakes) exist*. These concerns must be addressed before this module of web 4 reaches mass adoption. \n\nThe upside of biosecrets is they **cannot be lost**, and the account will always be **recoverable by the individual**. In a web 4 ecosystem, where the tokens are distributed daily and often spent daily, a hack would be much less catastrophic. The attacker will be able to access the user's balance, but not alter the past transactions, nor continue to collect the future deposits, because the real user will (in theory) quickly recover the account and change the biometric secret generation means so that the hacker's biofake is no longer working. \n\n___\n# **3**\n\n___\n\n##  Information Entropy\nWeb 3 focuses on storing information forever in a provable way. Web 4 introduces a **counter-model** which may be **optionally** adopted by any time-token-based system. In this model, who did what becomes **harder and harder to know** the more time that passes. \n\nThis idea hinges upon incremental time units, the number of which is used to decide how difficult information about a particular individual is to access. This can be implemented by increasing the difficulty required to verify a transaction chain, or economically by increasing the fees associated with accessing or interacting with old transactions or smart contracts. \n\nWith **information entropy**, it is difficult, but not impossible, to piece together a story about an individual user by knowing they are responsible for a set of transactions over time. The further back in time a transaction is, the **harder** it is to link it to another transaction with any **certainty**. \n\n## Information Entropy and Biosecrets\nInformation fidelity requirements can also be degraded over time. For example, when generating a user's biokey, it can be assumed that the more time that passes, the more the biometrics of the individual will change. \n\n### Degradation of Biokeys\n**Biokeys** are generated from a **range of biometric values**. This range of values can be expanded over time based on specific, well researched paths. The effect is, instead of having one hashed biokey for eternity, the generation process will create a set of biokeys from an increasingly **wide range of data**. This concept may be needed to keep people in control of their accounts as they age. There is considerable work to be done to develop this concept, as each data type has its own considerations and complications. \n\nIn this case, as time goes on, someone attempting to prove their individuality would have to spend a lot **more effort** to run the algorithms against their collected biodata, and the data **precision** needed to match the person's identity is actually **lower**. This is one example of **fidelity change**; others can make it more expensive to change a record from the past, make it harder to find out the ID of a voter, or even limit a past state's effect on the future of a blockchain. \n\n## Proceed with Caution \nWhile the inclusion of this concept into web 4 may seem **unnecessary** at the moment, it is another guarantee of the privacy that is needed for many **social applications**. Philosophically, degradation of information also fits in with the general web 4 desire to reflect [systems in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics). \n\nBefore moving on, I do wish to stress the modularity of web 4, and that this (perhaps the most radical idea presented) is not going to fit into every web 4 system, nor should it. This idea will find its usefulness when it is time, and should NOT be adopted without clear reasoning. \n\n\n___\n# **4**\n\n___\n# Geo-Social Systems: Geotribes + Geodomains\n\nThe geo-social systems apt to be improved by web 4 are those which involve **people collaborating**, like government/legislation, food and water management, community projects, education, events, charities, environmental protection and more. Web 4 can also be used by organizations so employees can have a direct say in the actions and direction of their companies and non-profits.\n\nCollaborative geo-social systems are always happening everywhere humans live. Currently, we are collectively deciding what direction we should be moving as a society, from representative governments, to social media. However, human growth in the past few centuries has been focused on technological improvements rather than social improvements. [3] To harness the power of the information age for the collaboration of humans, web 4 should be used to enhance, introduce, and replace current structures that organize our societies. \n\n&gt; Web 4 proposes that systems based in time token are the most apt to create and improve existing social layers. \n\n## What is a Geo-Social System?\n\nA geo-social system is something that affects people (**social**) at a given bounded area (**geo**). To refer to a group of people associated with a certain area, we'll call them a **geotribe**, and to refer to that area we'll call it a **geodomain**. \n\n## Concepts\n\n1. **Geodomain**: A bounded area that has an associated group of people who are running a democratic (web 4) system. \n\n2. **Geotribe**: The group of people associated with a geodomain that are participants in a web 4 system.\n\nGeodomains can be nested, with a finite set of smaller areas making up the larger area, common in geopolitics, but this is not required. Geodomains can also be overlapping or non-overlapping.\n\n\n## Creating Geo-social Systems\nTo create a geo-social system, we first must define the requirements of the geodomain, and then the requirements for an individual to be a part of the geotribe within that geodomain. \n\n### Geodomain Stratification  \nAcross the globe, **one geopolitical pattern** seems to emerge, though names vary. Cities are within Counties, are within States, are within Nations, are within the World. \n\n1. Cities (aka Towns, Commonwealths, etc.)\n2. Counties (aka Divisions\n3. States (aka Districts, Provinces)\n4. Nations (aka Countries, States, Republics, etc)\n5. Global\n \n&gt; Additionally, a **community level** may be added within cities to further add accuracy and usefulness. \n\nUsing this existing geopolitical stratification is recommended for those wishing to build a web 4 system because it makes varying global systems easily storable in a one relational database model or similar data structure, and is understood by local people, governments, etc. \n\nOnce we have our geodomains, we must define what makes a geotribe.  \n\n### Geotribal Bonds\nTraditionally, it's the existence within a certain area, such as a place of residence or business, that is of importance for things like taxes, voting, and citizenship. When building a geo-social system, it's only necessary that an association is declared that is relevant for that system, which may or may not involve proving residency. \n\nIt is important for every system that each individual only exist within one geotribe (excluding those extrapolated) so that their vote isn't counted twice. \n\nWhen using stratified geodomains, such as geopolitically-based ones, only the deepest level of association is needed (city/community), from which the rest can be extrapolated.\n\nIf a geopolitically-based geodomain system allows geotribe members to declare their own associated location without proof, the member is incentivized to be honest, as they will receive the most benefit from having their opinion heard where it matters to them. \n\nAll \"non-proof\" systems should place restrictions on switching voluntarily-given geodomain association too often (such as once per 6 months) to prevent influencing foreign affairs. \n \n\n# High-Fidelity Democracy \n\nBy offering time tokens to the individual that correspond to each stratum we can create **high-fidelity democratic systems** that better represent each and every person's desires. We can know exactly what the people want, with no guesswork and 0 middlemen, in a very short period of time. \n\nFor example, a person may be given 12 time tokens per month at each stratum to vote on the initiatives that they would like to see passed. They may vote all 12 tokens for an initiative they are most passionate about, or 1 token to 12 different initiatives (or 2 to 6 initiatives, etc). By collecting and counting these tokens, the governing body can **know exactly what their constituents want**, without the direct need to elect a representative who only estimates these desires. \n\nThe democratic system described in this paper does not solve all problems, as there are still issues of voter informedness, unseen actors, and more, but it is a skeleton to build a collaborative social system that are an **improvement to the representative governments** which were once as revolutionary as these ideas are. \n\n\n# Roadmap to Web 4 Reality\n\n## **Phase One**\n&gt; Implementing time tokens\n\n**Time Tokens** are implemented on any and all blockchains where developers see the value. These developers provide open-source instructions and tools to helps other developers incorporate time tokens into their applications. \n\n**Provable individuality** for Time Tokens is up to each application and blockchain, and these application can choose to ignore this requirement, risking their systems' integrity. **Federated** (Facetec) and **decentralized** (Civic) options may be used, and so can social verification (BrightID).\n\n**Information entropy** and **geo-social systems** are starting to be theorized, but not showing up. \n\n**Phase 1 Action Points**: \n- Time Token ERC proposal on Ethereum (and similar for other blockchains)\n- Developers exploring use cases for Time Tokens \n\n\n## **Phase Two**\n&gt; dApps and discovering issues\n\n**Applications using Time Tokens** are widespread, and issues in implementations are becoming known and solved. Developers who open time token faucets are seeing their token be used in third-party apps in ways they didn't foresee. \n\n**Provable identity issues** are becoming apparent, as certain applications with **lax rules** are being manipulated, showing the need for true provable identity. The best solutions are becoming known alongside the problems.\n\n**Information entropy** principles are starting to be implemented, when required.\n\n**Geo-social systems** are starting to be built, but not used for \"real applications\" like running a government because of lack of true provable individuality, and social inertia.\n\n**Phase 2 Action Points**: \n- Proposing the best uses for geo-social systems using time tokens\n- Incorporating different provable identity methods\n- Developers implementing Time Token in unexpected ways\n\n## **Phase Three**\n&gt; Implementing Provable Identity\n\n**Provable Identity** is now possible as suggested in this manifesto through the maturity of the biometric secrets. Standards are being created openly, or, it is decided that the way presented here is not needed as a better way is found.\n\n**Geo-social systems** are being used to run and govern communities which are not dependent on traditional representative government. Existing governments are adopting time tokens to get a better read on what legislation the people want. \n\nOrganizations of all sizes are using time tokens to shift power to employees. \n\n**Phase 3 Action Points**: \n- Picking provable identity solutions that satisfy all requirements\n- Possibly abandoning biometric system presented here\n- Communities running on web 4\n- Governments benefiting from web 4\n- Organizations using web 4\n\n## **Phase Four**\n&gt; Geo-social systems\n\n**Information entropy** is added to the systems where it can be of use. For example, this could make a person's (anonymous) voting record less knowable over time by increasing the amount of CPU time needed to associate one vote with another. \n\n**Geo-social systems** are being used as a replacement for representative government where it is the will of the people. Voter informedness is measured and known, as are the exact desires of the people. This creates collaboration and a renewed faith in democracy, and a feeling of belongingness and appreciation for each individual. \n\n**Phase 4 Action Points**: \n- Building and operating geo-social systems for the benefit of society and any collaborating group\n- Exploring use cases and integrating information entropy where appropriate\n\n# Author notes\n\n## Change Without Conflict\n**No one can stop us** from building collaborative systems with web 4 and even **self-governing**. **We don't need** to \"tear down the system\" or separate from society to do so. **Web 4 can exist** fully embedded in the geopolitical systems around us, while implementing and improving the four concepts, the underpinnings of collaborative democracy.\n\nIf and when the \"old system\" meets its demise, as all things do, **we can transition rapidly** to a web 4 system like [Effective Collective](https://github.com/dougbutner/effective-collective) or any other, as this solution will already be in place. \n\n## Why use the term \"Web 4\"\nIt is my belief that each version of the web must 1) be built on top of the previous version, 2) be fundamentally different than the previous version by introducing new technology, and 3) have meaningful impact on society. \n\nThis proposal for the next iteration of the web is an effort to both expand and shift the path of information science in a direction where the **meaningful impact** of society involves: 1) empowerment of each individual, which serve as the basis for collective (social), economic, and novel applications; 2) provable identity verification while maintaining complete separation from any federated system, including government, with the side-benefit of lifelong recoverability of biokeys with biosecrets; and 3) resonance with our contained and containing systems, like our human organs and the Solar system, which provide us with life and free energy daily, akin to free time tokens.\n\nWhile an argument could easily be made that DeFi is Web 4, or another emerging tech, like \"layer 2\" blockchains (rollups) are web 4, both of these are **not new**. DeFi mimics and improves the systems of the past. Rollups are merely making web 3 **more efficient**. \n\nIt is my hope and desire that the information presented here will be **expanded** on and **implemented** by many developers and systems in the coming years, not for the benefit of the few, but for the **empowerment** of each individual and the **harmony** of the human collective, and every layer of Gaia. \n\n___\n# Notes + References\n___\n\n[1] - Solutions like Civic and Facetec have proved to be effective in verifying individuality. KYC services rely on government-issued identification, physical signature, and minimal, often human-checked bioverification.

With DeFi, developers and product teams have the flexibility to build on top of existing protocols, customize interfaces, and integrate third-party applications. For this reason, people often call DeFi protocols “money legos.”\n* **Transparency.** On the public Ethereum blockchain, every transaction is broadcast to and verified by other users on the network (note: Ethereum addresses are encrypted keys that are pseudo-anonymous). This level of transparency around transaction data not only allows for rich data analysis but also ensures that network activity is available to any user. Ethereum and the DeFi protocols running on it are also built with open source code that is available for anyone to view, audit, and build upon.\n* **Permissionless.** Unlike traditional finance, DeFi is defined by its open, permissionless access: anyone with a crypto wallet and an Internet connection, regardless of their geography and often without any minimum amount of funds required, can access DeFi applications built on Ethereum.\n* **Self-Custody.** By using Web3 wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to interact with permissionless financial applications and protocols, DeFi market participants always keep custody of their assets and control of their personal data.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 0, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/jj0nhn/benefits_of_decentralized_finance/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

The teams enabling the tokenizing of BTC on Ethereum have been embracing this belief, and it is paying off. Also, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has such a strong gravity that even BTC holders have been finding ways to use it.\n\n**COMP AND YIELD FARMING**\n\nCompound released its governance token COMP in mid-June. Tokens have been rewarded daily to borrowers and lenders on Compound. The result has been that enterprising DeFi users have been maximizing their COMP yield (i.e. “yield farming”) by using DeFi mechanisms to unlock capital and then lending/borrowing on Compound. \n\nYield farming took the DeFi ecosystem by storm in the last two weeks of the quarter. Crucial metrics like ETH locked and daily active users soared after being fairly stagnant earlier in the quarter. However, data (discussed below) suggests the frenzy did not bring many new users into DeFi, demonstrating that DeFi’s innovation must be paired with education and UX before we see the DeFi community grow beyond its current borders.\n\n**3 MAJOR SECURITY INCIDENTS**\n\nUniswap, Lendf.me, and Balancer all had high-profile security incidents this quarter, collectively resulting in $26M USD stolen (most of which was returned, discussed below).\n\nSecurity incidents are inevitable in emerging technology.

The attack was made possible because Uniswap V1 does not have measures in place to guard against this type of reentrancy attack when interacting with the ERC-777 standard. In total, the hacker made away with \\~$300k USD in imBTC and ETH (\\~$141k ETH + \\~$160k imBTC). \n\nInterestingly, this attack vector was not unknown to Uniswap or to the crypto community at large. Almost exactly a year before the Uniswap attack, [ConsenSys Diligence](http://diligence.consensys.net/) \\- the security audit service offered by ConsenSys - [identified and published](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/uniswap-audit-b90335ac007) the ERC-777 reentrancy attack vector. Uniswap had plans to address the attack vector, as outlined in their [March 23 blog post](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/) about the features of Uniswap V2.\n\nAs DeFi protocols grow in number, complexity, and interconnectedness, more security vulnerabilities and compromises are likely to occur.

The tBTC system is a bonded, multi-federated peg made up of many deposits backed by single-use BTC wallets to enable their value’s corresponding usage on the Ethereum chain, primarily through the minting of a TBTC ERC20 token whose supply is guaranteed to be backed by at least 1 BTC per TBTC in circulation.\n\nfinally this is the best:\n\nhttps://tbtc.network/developers/tbtc-technical-system-overview\n\nhere is the first few pargarphs\n\n&gt; 2020-04-01\ntBTC incorporates novel design features that carry important implications for users. This piece explains four of these: TDT receipts, multiple lot sizes, Keep's random beacon, and threshold signatures.\n\n&gt; TBTC Deposit Token (TDT)\nThe TBTC Deposit Token (TDT) is a non-fungible token that is minted when a user requests a deposit. A TDT is a non-fungible ERC-721 token that serves as a counterpart to TBTC. It represents a claim to a deposit's underlying UTXO on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n&gt; TBTC deposits can be locked or unlocked. A locked deposit can only be redeemed by the deposit owner with the corresponding TDT. Each TDT is unique to the deposit that mints it and carries the exclusive right for up to a 6 month term to redeem the deposit.\n\nalso this paragraph addresses creating wallets with the created tokens\n\n&gt; **Random Beacon for Signer Selection**\n\n&gt; The Keep network requires a trusted source of randomness to select tBTC signers. This takes the form of a BLS Threshold Relay.\n\n&gt; When a request comes in to create a signing group, the tBTC system uses a random seed from a secure decentralized random beacon to randomly select signing group members from the eligible pool of signers. These signers coordinate a distributed key generation protocol that results in a public ECDSA key for the group, which is used to produce a wallet address that is then published to the host chain. This completes the signer selection phase.\n\n\nmy take away from this is that by using side chains that a trustless, not fedeared like liquid bitcoin sidechains sold by blockstream. it uses NFT erc-721 tokens as representation of the bitccoin UTXO from the bitcoin blockchain, store it in a wallet and mint it into tBTC. given this is all smart contracts generating wallets and minting the tBTC, it does away with the need of a centralised party to provide the funds of BTC to create a wrapped erc20 version on ethereum and so should be trustles.\n\nperhaps erc20 token trading is the way to go forward. just requires wrapping of exisitng tokens. this looks promising for DeXs and DeFi if it happens. \n\nalso opens the possibiliy of multicollateral Dai (MCD) using tBTC in addition to eth and BAT. though personally i think btc should not be used in MCD. \n\nany thoughts on this? or if my understanding is off.\n\nthanks\n\nedit: got some more info from /u/px403\n\n&gt; I talked to James a bit about tBTC in Osaka, so I have a vague idea of how it works, so I might be able to explain it in a somewhat coherent way.\n\n&gt; Basically, the magic here is they reimplemented Bitcoin's SPV as an Ethereum smart contract, effectively letting them query the current state of the Bitcoin network, including validity of payments, directly in contract. Using this, they built an auction system where people can at any time claim ETH by paying BTC, or claim BTC by paying ETH. By design the spread is wide, so this isn't actually intended to be a high volume exchange, but what you do get is a pretty good price oracle.\n\n&gt; From the price oracle, I think there were doing some Maker style CDPs or something, where people could lock up their BTC on the Bitcoin network to redeem tBTC, and any of the locked BTC could be reclaimed by burning tBTC or something.\n\n&gt; Sorry it's not a complete picture of what's going on, but I think that's the general gist of what they're doing.", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/ftvjcg/tbtc_an_erc20_wrapped_version_of_btc_like_erc20/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Nano founder Colin Lemahiue's responded with this in a recent AMA with ChangeNow:\n\n&gt; Q: I really see the use case of cryptos for smart contracts. Payments only, nope.\n\n&gt; A: Smart contracts can’t cause side effects to happen. They can’t move property and they can’t negotiate unforeseen disputes. When you carefully look at it, all smart contracts take the form of a prepayment and slow release of locked-up funds. People haven’t and won’t use this for multiple reasons. Economically the opportunity cost of locked-up funds means they can’t be used elsewhere while locked up. From a practical standpoint, something simple like a rental smart contract could mean you’d have to lock up your year’s rent to slowly trickle out to your landlord. People simply don’t have this much money to lock up. Smart contracts can’t sample unforeseen circumstances, something like a judge ruling in contradiction to a smart contract means it will continue to operate incorrectly given the new situation. Oracles in smart contracts will very quickly become infeasible. Consider writing a contract about a building in a remote town, who is the person that’s going to go on location, make the determination, and feed the input into the system? How are we sure they aren’t coerced to lie?\n\nI think smart contracts do have some uses like for decentralized fair gambling and gaming where you lock up funds just for short periods of time, but maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves thinking they are world changing.\n\nThoughts?", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/f2dt9f/are_smart_contracts_and_defi_really_that_useful/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

This function call required the user to pay fees in ETH.\nIn the new MCD Dai token, a new contract function was introduced by Maker under the name of “permit”. This function allows the user to make an allowance to any address via a meta-transaction (signed message) instead of a manual transaction. The gas fees for this transaction can be subsidized by a relayer.\n\n... few paragraphs down, \n\n&gt; The Gasless contract regulates the relationship between the Mosendo relayer and the user while ensuring that the relayer is trustless by only accepting meta-transactions that are authenticated by the user via signed messages. In exchange for its service, the relayer is also paid a Dai fee by the user in order to cover the transaction gas cost and running cost of the relayer infrastructure.\n\nThis is compatible with metamask and perhaps the new browser \"Web3\" wallets, opera and brave are the first desktop ones to support it natively without extension. though the wallet is quite basic compared to metamask.\n\nThe Web3 term makes me cringe as a dev, as it reminds me of \"web 2.0\" a few years back; which was really just an improvement of front end frameworks e.g. angular and backend API perforamnce, and more generally evolution of the tech css / ease of layout tech (bootstrap) etc. \n\nI see web3 as pretty much a browser with a the ability to interact with blockchain, and thats with a wallet.

So far I've only found [Blockchain at Berkeley\n](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5sgoRfoSp3jeX4DEqKLwKg), [IOHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w) (probably biased towards Cardano) and for news related stuff [Ivan on tech](https://www.youtube.com/user/LiljeqvistIvan) (who's one of the few daily crypto youtubers that's not a complete idiot). \n\nIf somebody knows more resources especially university lectures and the like, please share it here!", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 11, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/88d4cb/what_are_good_youtube_channels_podcasts_or_moocs/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}
{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "86wfhl", "author": "Neophyte-", "handle": "Neophyte-", "created_utc": 1521929531.0, "text": "Noticed the huge rise of EOS lately what does it have over NEO and ethereum and to a lesser extent Cardano? I tried researching it, but wasn't sold. I tried to research the differences, but i dont really see anything that makes it a huge selling point over NEO in particular, and ethereum is improving with a solid road map, plasma and sharding for example. \n\nIn terms of consensus, I see that EOS is using dPoS, but eth is moving to PoS anyway, NEO uses dBFT which is faster anyway. On that note, is dPoS dangerous? delegating block creation to a few nodes makes me wonder if changes to EOS may be hard to implement e.g. a delegate decides they don't like risking a hard fork, or is this a moot point and not a risk with dPoS?\n\nWhat EOS has is 0 transaction fees, so thats a good pro in their book. they also talk about the async nature of their dApp communication with transactions. but who cares? i think this pattern is easily implemented in other dApp protocols, i think its analogous to async / await patterns you see in programming langauges .net and the new ECMA standard, im sure other langauges have the same thing. \n\nI noticed that EOS is limiting the \"chattyness\" on there launch, dApps can only have 40 messages in a transaction (i read this last night, so i'm probably not articulating this correctly). This seems to be a way to ensure the network is not bogged down by dApps, but i dont think its the right way to go about it. I think allowing off chain processing like ethereum is planning with plasma much better. thats just my thinking, i could be way off, so correct me if im wrong.\n\nOn that note of chattyness, how is cpu, transactions, memory usage controlled to handle the network? we have GAS in ethereum. How does it work in EOS? I couldn't find an answer.\n\nWhen it comes to programming languages, im not too fussed, they are promoting that their languages in EOS compile into c++, which is great. but solidity has great performance too. Infact, i think the programming languages available to build a dApp is over rated as a selling point. you can compile into native with many languages. You do have the special case with functional langauges like Haskell in Cardano, functional langauges generally lead to code that has less bugs, much steeper learning curve than imperative languages however, but i dont see that as being a problem.\n\nOverall, I don't see massive pros in EOS vs NEO and Ethereum (with its upcoming changes). Cardano i mentioned because it has a great white paper, but at this stage they havent delivered much and might be too late.\n\nI know this is a DYOR, but whats the rollout like for EOS? I don't believe its a working product yet, while NEO and Eth are. The thing with smart contracts protocols is that they can just implement ideas from other smart contract coins, however its always good to have these from the begining, to avoid forks. But even so i think the network effect of Eth and NEO will dominate the space unless EOS and Cardano can get in quick with a good use case to use them as a dApp platform, as NEO and Eth will improve over time. Of course people could migrate their dApp later when a better smart contract platform comes around. but i imagine thats not easy when you've already established yourself on one dApp platform (am i wrong?)\n\nthoughts? I'm scratching my head at why it just blew up. Doesnt seem to offer anything mind blowing over existing working product smart contract coins.", "lang": null, "likes": 53, "replies": 53, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/86wfhl/noticed_the_huge_rise_of_eos_lately_what_does_it/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}
{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "7znnq8", "author": "tracyspacygo", "handle": "tracyspacygo", "created_utc": 1519388594.0, "text": "My brief observation of most common Consensus Algorithms I have studied most common consensus algorithms. Here is the summary, maybe for someone it will be helpful. My goal is to describe every specific consensus briefly so everyone can easily understand it. *Please let me know if I have wrote something wrong, or maybe you are aware of interesting algorithm, I have missed.\n\n[Proof of Work] - very short, cuz it's well-known.\n\n[1] Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.\n\nOthers: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.\n\n[Hybrid of PoW and PoS]\n\n[2] Decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. Blocks are created about every 5 minutes. Nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (PoW). Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution. Stakeholders who have locked some DCR in return for a ticket* now have the chance to vote on the block (PoS). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. Both miners and voters are compensated with DCR : PoS - 30% and PoW - 60% of about 30 new Decred issued with a block. * 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. Stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets. \n\n[Proof of Stake]\n\n[3] Nxt - The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.\n\n[4] Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.\n\n[5] Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity) - quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.\n\n[6] Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism\" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.\n\n[7] Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake) - Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -&gt; At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -&gt; Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -&gt; As &gt;51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.\n\n[8] Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake) - Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -&gt; Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -&gt; Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -&gt; Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.\n\n[9] Tezos (Proof Of Stake) - generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. At the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -&gt; Using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to Follow The Satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle*. -&gt; Blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). \nMining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing.\n* the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer.\n\n[10] Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by &gt;2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -&gt; Prevote -&gt; Precommit -&gt; Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.\n\n[11] Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -&gt; Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -&gt; Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes &gt;2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -&gt; As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs &gt;2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -&gt; As &gt;2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.\n\n[12] NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - Consensus nodes* are elected by NEO holders -&gt; The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -&gt; He broadcasts proposal to create block -&gt; Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -&gt; Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -&gt; Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -&gt; Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-&gt; Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)\n\n[13] EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. *the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power\n\n[The XRP Ledger Consensus Process]\n\n[14] Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications -&gt; Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -&gt; Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -&gt; all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -&gt; final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -&gt; after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -&gt; All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -&gt; Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -&gt; Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.\n\n[The Stellar consensus protocol]\n\n[15] Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement) - quit similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.\n\n[Proof of Burn]\n\n[16] Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -&gt; Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.\n\n[Proof of Importance]\n\n[17] NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.\n\n[Proof of Devotion]\n\n[18] Nebulas (Proof of Devotion + BFT) - quite similar to POI, the PoD selects the accounts with high influence.  All accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (Nebulas Rank) -&gt; Top-ranked accounts are selected -&gt; Chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks Validators* -&gt; Algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block Proposer -&gt; After a new block is proposed, Validators Set (each Validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of BFT-Style voting to verify block (1. Prepare stage -&gt; 2. Commit Stage. Validators should have &gt; 2/3 of total deposits to validate Block) -&gt; Block is added. Block rewards : each Validator rewarded with 1 NAS.\n*Validators Set is dynamic, changes in Set may occur after Epoch change. \n\n[IOTA Algorithm]\n\n[19] IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -&gt; New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.\n\n[PBFT + PoW]\n\n[20] Yobicash - uses PBFT and also PoW. Nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. A node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. As follow : Node receives new transaction -&gt; Checks if valid -&gt; queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in DAG ) -&gt; queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -&gt; if everything is ok add to DAG. Reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins. \n\n[Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity]\n\n[21] Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.\n\n[Proof of Elapsed Time]\n\n[22] Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -&gt; The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -&gt; The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -&gt; Block Validators check block -&gt; Block is created on top of blockchain. \n\n[Other]\n\n[23] Byteball (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - only verified nodes are allowed to be Validation nodes (list of requirements https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness). Users choose in transaction set of 12 Validating nodes. Validating nodes(Witnesses) receive transaction fees.   \n\n[24] Nano - uses DAG, PoW (HashCash). Nano uses a block-lattice structure. Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. To add transaction user should make some HashCash PoW -&gt; When user creates transaction Send Block appears on his blockchain and Receive block appears on Recipients blockchain. -&gt; Peers in View receive Block -&gt; Peers verify block (Double spending and check if already in the ledger) -&gt; Peers achieve consensus and add block.\nIn case of Fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block):  Nano network resolves forks via a  balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as &gt;50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the Node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded). \n\n[25] Holochain - uses distributed hash table (DHT). Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. In case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every neighbor node validate it.\nAny consensus algorithms can be built on top of Holochain.\n\n[26] Komodo ('Delegated' Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. DPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize The Longest Chain Rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dPoW looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen PoW blockchain. The process of inserting backups of Komodo transactions into a secure PoW is “notarization.” Notarisation is performed by the elected Notary nodes. Roughly every ten minutes, the Notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the Komodo blockchain and take note of the overall Komodo blockchain “height”. The notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. There are sixty-four “Notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of KMD represents stake in the election. They are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.”\n\npost with references you can find here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2936428.msg30170673#msg30170673", "lang": null, "likes": 157, "replies": 48, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7znnq8/my_brief_observation_of_most_common_consensus/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Often you can make everything look good and work now with focused optimizations, but you'll pay in the future when the solution isn't flexible or scalable enough. Alternatively you can take the time to think through all the long term needs and build a robust solution, but this can take longer and perform worse in the short run.\n\nI'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how different crypto projects approach this trade off.\n\nFor example, I think the toxic bitcoin scaling debate basically boils down to the following. **Bitcoin Core:** \"Satoshi's whitepaper and block size increases only allow for linear scaling, so increasing block sizes now will give a short term boost at the expense of long term scalability as the blockchain grows. We should prepare for other solutions.\"  **Bitcoin Cash:** \"We need on-chain scaling NOW consistent with the whitepaper or bitcoin will become unuseable and die before any other solutions can be built.\"\n\nI think Vitalik and the dev team are very conscious of the balance between short and long term with Ethereum. Instead of starting with a half-baked Proof of Stake implementation that could limit future work, they started with the tried and tested Proof of Work while developing and thinking through the implementation for the best long term Proof of Stake model. I think many Ethereum competitors (NEO, EOS, Cardano, etc) need hype and funding now, so they use designs that are very fast short term but could be at the expense of long term sustainability. I could design a super fast system that elects one node to handle all transactions and I could post videos to Reddit how excited I am to see sub 1 second transfer times between wallets. Of course this system would fail when scaled due to node bottlenecks and node election issues.\n\nAn example of a project I think is solely focused on long term at the expense of short term is IOTA. There are all kinds of usability issues and complaints with current setup, but the devs seem to be laser focused on their long term vision as an IoT protocol and aren't making many design compromises to make the system work better today. Time will tell whether they will make it to their long term vision, or if developers will switch to something like RaiBlocks that is more usable now but maybe has more questionable long term prospects.\n\nAny thoughts on other projects and the now vs future tradeoff?", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7soi7d/short_and_long_term_design_tradeoffs_in_crypto/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}
