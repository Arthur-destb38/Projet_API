I’ve spent the last few weeks digging into Bitcoin’s performance, the macro trends behind the big moves, and a ton of alternative data that shows how public interest is changing. Here’s what I found.\n\n**1. Bitcoin’s last two years were wild.**  \nWe went from the post-FTX depression to new highs above $126k, then back down into the mid-$80k range. Even with the big pullback, the long term move is still incredibly strong.\n\n**2. The rally was mostly driven by three (maybe four) things:** \n\n* Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States finally going live\n* The 2024 halving and the predictable scarcity narrative\n* Expectations for lower interest rates and a friendlier macro backdrop\n* The new US administration is, in lack of a better word, more crypto-friendly than the former administration\n\n**3. The hedge debate is more complicated than people make it.**  \nAfter digging into studies and price behavior, my takeaway is this:  \nBitcoin can hedge long term debasement because of its fixed supply, but it does not behave like a short term hedge against the dollar. Money supply has been rising lately, but bitcoin hasn't followed. When markets de-risk, Bitcoin usually sells off in the same direction as tech stocks. Bitcoin might still protect you from a long term weak dollar, but not from short term risk-off / volatility.\n\n**4. The alternative data surprised me. Interest is cooling.**  \nThis is the part I didn’t expect to be so obvious:\n\n* Google searches for “Bitcoin” are down nearly 50 percent YoY\n* r/Bitcoin subreddit growth has slowed to just 1 percent in the last 3 months\n* Bitcoin’s Wikipedia views dropped from \\~10k per day to \\~4k\n* Sentiment across crypto forums is turning bearish\n\nIt feels like excitement has cooled even though the price is still up massively over two years. \n\n**5. What I’m watching next:**  \n• ETF inflows or outflows  \n• The Fed’s approach to rates  \n• Whether search interest and community momentum pick back up  \n• Any regulatory shifts, especially since the Trump administration has historically been more pro-crypto\n\n**My personal take:**  \nBitcoin still makes sense as a long term asset with a fixed supply and global adoption. But in the short run it behaves like a high beta macro trade, not a clean hedge. The data shows retail attention is fading, which might mean we are in the middle of a cooling phase rather than a new explosive rally.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.

Bitcoin dropped as low as $94,700 on Friday, the lowest the crypto has traded in about six months.\n\nWaning liquidity, this week's tech sell-off, and rumored selling from Strategy were adding pressure.\n\nBitcoin has been hurt amid a broader sell-off in risk assets, with tech stocks in particular getting hit hard as investors fret over high valuations.\n\nOutflows from spot bitcoin ETFs hit $866.7 million on Thursday, according to data from CoinGlass, the worst outflow bitcoin funds have seen since early August.\n\n\"In some ways, Bitcoin was a leading indicator for risk,\" David Nicholas, the CEO of XFUNDS, wrote in a note this week, pointing to recent concerns among investors about valuations in the stock market. \"I think it's the perfect recipe for Bitcoin price weakness,\" he added.\n\nBitcoin's liquidity has also dropped off over the last month, a possible reason the crypto's price has seen more volatility.\n\nBitcoin's market depth, a measure of how resistant its price is to volatility stemming from large trades, dropped from around $766 million in early October $535.2 million as of this week, according to the crypto analytics firm Kaiko.\n\nThe sell-off picked up steam on Friday as Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy and one of bitcoin's biggest cheerleaders over the years, fended off online rumors that his crypto treasury dumped some of its bitcoin holdings.\n\n\"I think the volatility comes with the territory,\" Saylor said of the latest sell-off.\n\n[Read the full story on why Bitcoin might wipe out its gains for the year here.](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-bitcoin-is-falling-btc-price-selloff-saylor-strategy-tech-2025-11?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=insider-bitcoinmarkets-sub-comment)", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ox30qv/3_reasons_bitcoin_is_on_the_brink_of_wiping_out/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Hence the recent drop.\n\nIn other words, there’s a time-frame mismatch across these assets:\n- BTC reacts almost instantly to current liquidity conditions (USD crunch due to the shutdown).\n- Equities price in future liquidity (6–12 months ahead).\n\nWhat this could mean for the future:\n\n- Bitcoin — being less institutionalized and more speculative — reacts to short-term cash flows, not forward guidance. So until liquidity returns, BTC may lag.\n- I expect the U.S. government shutdown to be resolved eventually — like previous ones.\n- If rate-cut probability remains high or the Fed actually cuts rates in October, BTC could snap upward quickly, while equities may stay relatively flat (since they’ve already priced in the easing).\n\nTL;DR: \nGold is rising as a safe-haven, equities are pricing in future liquidity/rate cuts, and Bitcoin is down because short-term USD liquidity is tight. Once the shutdown ends and rate cuts happen, BTC may rebound sharply, while stocks may stay flat.\n\n\nThis is just my take — happy to discuss the fund flows/liquidity perspective and hear other viewpoints.", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1o15c1e/october_outlook/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1mu3zrr", "author": "New-Ad-9629", "handle": "New-Ad-9629", "created_utc": 1755564522.0, "text": "Any news about balances on OTC desks (since early August)? For those who might not know, big institutions like Strategy and Blackrock buy their bitcoin 'over the counter' (OTC desks). Large trades such as these are NOT done on exchanges, and hence it doesn't affect the price. For eg, we recently heard about the [$9 billion sale of BTC](https://www.cryptoninjas.net/news/galaxy-digital-offloads-9-billion-in-bitcoin-without-triggering-a-crash/) without really moving the price on the exchanges at all. \n\nExperts can correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding of how this works is as follows: these OTC desks connect large whales (buyers and sellers) and execute the trade using the price on the exchanges at the time of the trade. For eg if the price on the exchange is $120k, the OTC trade will be carried out at this price without really affecting the price on the exchanges at all. \n\nNow the question is, what happens when the OTC supply runs out, i.e. When there are no sellers left (at the current price). The balance on OTC desks has dropped sharply, about 75% from over 400,000 coins to just above 150,000 coins. Not all the coins on the exchanges are for sale. When the demand outstrips the supply, whales will have to buy on open exchanges. This will create a [supply shock](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-demand-shock-uncork-btc-price-otc-desks-run-dry) (what everyone has been talking about for years). \n\nWhat will a supply shock look like? Well, there will be sudden increases in price, and with every new high (125k, 130k... 200k) we'll continue to see more and more sellers. The supply will never be zero, but the point is - the demand will be much much higher. \n\nI'm curious to know if anyone here has done more research on this, and can add or correct anything that I've written.

I drew a line at the valuation's bottom at 6.38 million sats per SPX. When Bitcoin pumped late last fall/ earlier winter, the S&amp;P fell bellow the 6.38 million sats level, but then something interesting happened. This level, which I doubted anyone else was watching, became resistance. Recently, however, as Bitcoin dumped, the level has become support for SPX.

Hey r/BitcoinMarkets \n\nJust wanted to share something cool I've been working on. I built an AI-powered signal for crypto futures trading. The idea was simple: tap into the incredible intelligence of advanced LLM models and let them guide my crypto trades. I've been feeding these models tons of crypto data, fine-tuning them specifically for market moves. To avoid bias from any single model, I'm actually using multiple cutting-edge LLMs and combining their predictions into one solid trading signal. All process are systematic.\n\nWhy crypto futures? Honestly, mainly because shorting is straightforward, making it easier to act quickly on signals.\n\nHere's a debut signal I put out yesterday—check it out if you're curious: [https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal](https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal)\n\nIt accurately called a short on Bitcoin with exact entry, stop-loss, and take-profit points.

These figures indicate buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. Details below:\n\nIf one can’t explain in a sentence what a company does, then it’s unlikely to be a good company. The way BTC miners make money is by acquiring BTC at lower than market value and either selling immediately (like IREN) or holding until BTC price goes up (like LSK). Personally, I do not like it when BTC miners change plans last minute. Unlike RIOT who just announced HPC-AI interest, IREN has a track record of high operational uptime (which is necessary for HPC-AI) and has provided HPC-AI services since 2019.\n\nIn a nutshell, both CLSK and IREN have higher operational uptime (Figure 2) and higher efficiency (Figure 3) than competitors RIOT and MARA. Consistently meeting quarterly goals demonstrates efficient growth by IREN and CLSK and exemplifies why these two businesses expand (gaining market share) while competitors (like RIOT and MARA) scramble to mimic others to attract investors.\n\nWhen it comes to companies holding BTC, CLSK may have more upside than others. Currently, most BTC miners have high percent shorts: CLSK (27.13%), MARA (24.12%), RIOT (19.91%), IREN (7.45%). As a rule of thumb, all shorts must eventually close positions which leads to more buy orders. BTC miners have been lagging BTC due in part to these high shorts and also by the end of year retail sell off brought on by the December federal reserve meeting. However, not every miner prioritizes shareholder value and it’s important to do your own research before buying into these higher risk stocks which are now trading at a much cheaper price.\n\nCLSK has set itself up to be most shareholder friendly BtC holder this bull run. Factors that support CLSK include NO plans for additional ATM's, full funding for growth to 50 EH/s and industry low % revenue going to compensation (Figure 4). Unlike MARA (48.4%) and RIOT (79%), IREN and CLSK have only 29.24% and 24.38% of revenue going towards paying compensation (which is good for shareholders). On 1/10/2025, MARA announced a 300M dilution which will dilute current shareholders by 60%. Because MARA has 333M shares, this potentially means each MARA share can drop close to 50% within a day whenever this dilution gets processed. Furthermore, plans to grow by 7 EH/s and/or pursue HPC-AI means RIOT may likely seek another $750M ATM at the cost of shareholders.\n\nOkay, okay… so what does this all mean? To figure that out, we have to take a look at some numbers...\n\nCLSK will likely have the highest amount BTC holdings in June 2025 per dollar spent TODAY on CLSK shares REGARDLESS of BTC price at $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k. This is based on figures which add up current BTC holdings and projected mining revenue (Figures 5 to 8) with averaged out monthly growth based on current EH/s goals. The amount held in BTC is then divided by market cap (corrected for dilution and ATM) to give the projected percent BTC holding per market cap as shown by Figure 1.\n\nThis means that buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. The goal in buying BTC miners is to pick a company that acquires BTC cheaper which generates enough profit to outpace the gains one gets buying BTC. Unlike CLSK whose competitive advantage is finding sites at low cost, RIOT and MARA copied MSTR and took out loans via convertible notes to buy spot BTC. This artificially raised their BTC holdings and only leads to further release of ATM’s and/or dilution at the expense of shareholders tomorrow.\n\nOut of good faith to those interested, I investigated this industry and formed my opinions based on the numbers I have observed. For CLSK, TTM price-to-sale (P/S) will likely drop by June 2025 to \\~3.58 (which indicates \\~2x value at current prices). CLSK had 39.1 EH/s with revenue of 668 BTC ($70.2M) in December 2024 which beat average revenue of 514 BTC from May 2024 to November 2024. With CLSK fully funding growth of 11.9 more EH/s (30.4%) by H1 2025, CLSK revenue will increase monthly by \\~5% for a TTM annual revenue of 8,070 BTC ($807M).\n\nThe lower projected 3.58 P/S for CLSK is NOT priced in and does NOT account for holdings which would be \\~13913 BTC ($1.39B) by June 2025 at $100k. If BTC reaches $150k by mid 2025, industry low cost of \\~$64k per coin mined means CLSK makes \\~$694M PROFIT from July 2024 to June 2025. This means CLSK would make $50k MORE PROFIT per coin mined than each coin RIOT and MARA bought at \\~$100k. This is where the REAL value lies with mining stocks. If done efficiently, profits can be made, and shareholders can benefit too.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided above is for general informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

It turns out that the smoke was probably the beginning of the new Kenneth fire. Shortly after we got home, there was a large plume of smoke and then it was clear this was a new fire. The winds were high and most of the fire fighters were working on the big LA fires so it was hard to know how it would evolve. Within about 10 minutes, we got an “evacuation warning” on our cell phones.  In the language of public emergency messages “evacuation warning” means pack up and get ready to leave, while “evacuation order” means get out and go now.\n\n As it turns out, we had a written list of items to pull together for evacuations, so I pulled that out and started working through the list as calmly as I could manage. When I got to the wallet thumb drive, I went to where it was supposed to be and my heart sank: It was not there. Around this time, the sheriff drives by with a bullhorn and I thought he was telling us to evac now. At this point, I am relieved that I have a backup drive with a relative far away, because my wife has a number of medical issues and reduced mobility, so I just don’t have time to figure out why my thumb drive is not where it is supposed to be.  I gather up a few more things and head out to the car and make sure the wife is ready, because for all I know this is the last time we see our house before it joins the many smoldering ruins that we’ve seen on the news. \n\nNow it turns out (thank all the gods) that this was as far into hell as we descended. The actual end of the story went like this: I went outside, and my neighbors were talking to a firefighter. He told us that as long as the winds did not shift, we would likely not have to evacuate, which meant that I had misunderstood what the sheriff driving around with a bullhorn was saying.  (The sheriff was making sure that everyone knew we should prepare to evacuate in case they missed the cell phone message, and the key thing that I misheard is that people *who need a lot of time* should go now.) The fire then grew to about a 1000 acres before it was officially stopped. I will never let a fire fighter buy his own drink from now on. \n\nHowever, just before going outside and learning that we were probably going to be OK, there were about a million thoughts racing through my head about how inadequately I had prepared for the possible endings. Now, I thought I was prepared (I had a list! I had a portable backup drive!) but what was most missing from my emergency planning: For a long-time hodler, life is going to change. Your spouse might develop a serious medical issue, and your parent might start showing signs of dementia. You might need to take care of an injured spouse during evacuation, and you will have precisely zero time to allot to your wallet backup plan, because (trust me on this): What is ultimately important becomes screamingly obvious during such moments, and it turns out that btc is not at the top of your list. \n\nMemorizing passphrases etc is good and all, but you are going to age too. You may suffer an injury in the disaster you are escaping from and you yourself will start experiencing memory loss. So whatever password is only in your head? Definitely rethink that strategy.\n\nThat drive you left with an aging parent? They did not know (or did not remember) that you thought it was important. They are preparing to sell their home and downsize, so it went into the trash. (This was roughly true in my case, as I found out later that week. *That* would have been a bad surprise.)\n\nHow about where you are going to escape to? Cell phone service was essentially dead. There are bars on the phone (the cell towers are active) but within certain cells you cannot get data or a phone call out. I hope that 911 service was still there (I sure as hell wasn’t going to test it without an actual emergency, those guys were full of them already) and that is why the cell service was alive at all. So you will need some type of offline map. You may think you know the roads, but imagine everyone in your area leaving: Do you know the side roads? How far away?  As you probably heard, there were cases were folks needed to walk away from their cars. This happened because those particular roads were funnels with no productive side streets to utilize. [In one report](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/residents-evacuate-and-flee-as-palisades-fire-grows/), LAFD told people to get out of their cars to escape the flames and then the fire depts bulldozed them out of the way, and [in another](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfire-windstorm-01-07-25#cm5n82fuo00003b6m6dg9oc1x) report, folks considered heading to the beach in order to escape the flames. \n\nThere is even the case that you are not allowed into your home: When coming back from the hike, I already smelled the smoke. But a little while later, and our path would have been blocked. Does your backup plan include geodiverse recovery? It very much needs to. \n\nTo give you a sense of the blindness that will occur as you are trying to calmly exit and not panic: My backup USB was just a little further down on the shelf. It is now part of a go-bag that I will keep and review every N months (N=6? I think), so that there is one less item to grab. \n\nSo in summary, there are three cases:\n\n* When you are away and your house evaporates for some reason: Have a geodiverse backup, independent of people if possible.\n* When there is no time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/), btc backup should be in it.\n* When there is time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/) with your btc backup, have a written list of other things to pack. The top of the list should be things you grab first in case you don't have time to grab them all.", "lang": null, "likes": 35, "replies": 26, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i54bls/post_emergency_analysis_psa_what_went_right_and/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I’m set on using a DCA (dollar-cost averaging) methodology, but with a bit of a twist. Instead of buying regularly at fixed intervals, I accumulate Bitcoin over time and occasionally increase my investment when the market dips significantly.\n\nCurrently, I’m using Binance to trade futures contracts and take long positions. My strategy looks something like this:\n\n1. I buy futures long contracts periodically, following a modified DCA approach.\n2. I use low leverage, typically 3x, to manage risk.\n3. When the market experiences a sharp dip, I increase my investment slightly more than usual to take advantage of the opportunity.\n4. When the position reaches a certain percentage of profit (depending on market conditions), I sell and lock in the gains.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nI’m worried about the funding fees that come with futures. I understand that these fees slowly eat into my position’s value over time, which means that if I hold a position for too long, a chunk of the profit goes towards these maintenance costs.\n\nMy Questions for You:\n\n1. Would it make more sense to switch entirely to the spot market, trade Bitcoin there, and avoid the funding fees? I’m not looking to hold BTC long term—I just want to profit from trading. However, with spot trading, I lose the ability to use leverage, which could limit my returns.\n2. Does it make sense to stick with futures contracts and my modified DCA strategy using low leverage (3x)? This approach allows me to grow my position faster and take advantage of leverage, but the funding fees are a concern.\n\nWhat would you recommend for someone who:\n\n* Trades on Binance and is familiar with the platform.\n* Wants to profit from BTC price movements rather than holding it long term.\n* Prefers to use low leverage to minimize risks (3x).\n* Occasionally increases investments during significant market dips to take advantage of lower prices.\n* Is actively monitoring the market and trades regularly.\n\nI’m also curious about your experiences with funding fees and whether anyone has successfully used futures with a low-leverage DCA strategy on Binance.

This may suit older investors who can’t handle large drops since they need the funds for retirement living so are happy to pay for the ‘insurance’ but still get exposure to large upside. There may be ‘mid-level’ and ‘aggressive’ variants to protect against 40% and 60% drops with progressively lower MER. \n\nI’m sure advanced investors, companies and institutions already do this manually but this would be pre-packaged product for the average investor in their IRA/RRSP.

They seem to occur approximately a year after Bitcoin hits ATH for that 4 year cycle.  Here are some notable past retractions.\n\n1. December 2013 : Bitcoin = $1000.\nDecember 2014: Bitcoin = $375.(62% drop)\n\n2.December 2017 : Bitcoin = $17,000.\nDecember 2018 : Bitcoin = $3,200.(80% drop)\n\n3.November 2021 : Bitcoin = $64,000.\nNovember 2022: Bitcoin = $16,000.(75% drop)\n\nSo why does this happen?  And will it happen this current cycle?\n\nThe why:\n\nFor each price retraction, you can potentially argue for unique reasons why they occurred.  For example, in 2022 the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 7 times, from nearly 0 to 4.25-4.50%.\n\nBut in general, I believe the reliable timing of these price retractions (admittedly with only 3 data points) signal that they occur due to pure crowd psychology and the fact that demand side buying pressure is difficult to sustain over long periods of time.  Remember that demand typically increases approx. one year prior to halving and at this point in the cycle, increased demand needs to be sustained for nearly 3 continuous years to keep increasing price.\n\nThe factors at ATH are: \n1. Investors begin taking profits.\n2. People who bought near the top due to FOMO (and have little regard for fundamentals) see this correction due to selling pressure and panic sell, fueling further losses.  \n3.  The news cycle starts to report on the “bubble bursting,” often reporting headlines without proper context (“Bitcoin down 35%!” Without stating the time period it was down 35%)\n4. Many investors of Bitcoin are aware of the 4 year cycle.  And while we collectively prepare for the post halving bull run, as price reaches a hypothetical ATH, it’s every man for himself in terms of exit strategy.  You take profits based on your own unique financial situation.  Demand side pressure slowly decreases, and the price trades sideways for months, followed by slow losses but constant losses each month.\n\nConclusion: So will we see another price retraction this cycle?\n\nAnswer:  Most likely, yes.  But it depends on why you believe they occur.  If you believe, as I do, that price retractions are fundamentally due to 2 things-The difficulty in sustaining increased demand side buy pressure over 3 continuous years and basic crowd psychology-\n\nThen, yes, a huge price retraction is coming one year after BTC hits ATH.  If Bitcoin maxes out at 150k in December 2025, history tells us that December 2026 could reveal a Bitcoin price of $50,000 (65% drop.). \n\nIf you believe that each price retraction was unique in nature, then no, there may not be one this cycle.  \n\nCheers!", "lang": null, "likes": 25, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h24dzb/lets_talk_about_bitcoin_price_retractions_why/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Many people assumed that knowing the multiplier would enable you to calculate a future price by simple multiplication of the net amount of dollars invested. [ I posted a calculation showing that using their multiplier was not so simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194358b/price_estimates_using_the_boa_multiplier/), and the price goes as the square root of the total dollars invested.\n\nSo as we approach $100K/btc, I was curious how things have played out over nearly a year.  I am going to assume that the total dollars locked into bitcoin for the multiplier is equal to the total ETF investment given [here](https://farside.co.uk/btc/) ($30.8B).  Also, I'm going to add in the total MSTR investment as given [here](https://mstr-tracker.com/) ($16.5B), and since I don't have the full MSTR ownership history, we're going to assume it all happened this year, which is an overestimate, but since my total investment is ETF+MSTR only, hopefully the overestimate captures some of the other investment that is being ignored.\n\nWith those (somewhat crappy) assumptions, and using the BoA multiplier value of 135, **the price predicted is $147K per bitcoin**.\n\nOK, that's pretty far off. What could contribute to the error?\n\n1. My overestimate of MSTR ownership happening all in the current year\n2. The multiplier as calculated by BoA is too high\n3. TheRe ARe EvIL mAnIpUlaTORs KEePING ThE PriCE DoWn!!1!\n\nMy best guess is reason 2, so I can turn around the calculation and use a current price of $97K and **solve for the multiplier instead. which turns out to be close to 50 at a price of $47K.**\n\nI found it to be an interesting way of looking at price prediction in any case, and I have to wonder what price discovery is going to look like above $100K because I find it difficult to believe that BoA's multiplier is going continue to make any sense if the price accelerates higher.\n\nEdit: To /u/[FreshMistletoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreshMistletoe/) point below, there's another way to look at it.

By day trading with $150, I've earned about $16 (with fees accounted for) and paid about $20 in trading fees. Whereas if I kept the SATS I bought originally, they'd have gained about $49 in value. Therefore, my ultimate takeaway is that day trading offers a way to keep the money in circulation, possibly the ability to keep money safer from the market drops, but in the end also shields you from potential long term gains as well.\n\nI wanted to perform this analysis to compare potential of day trading to long term investments and out of curiosity. My takeaway is that weekends are generally great for price increases, and generally price will dip before and after the weekend.

I am looking into using leverage for swing trading. I am still new to this and won't consider actually leverage trading before I better understand it, don't worry.\n\nHere's a scenario. I hold 1 BTC and I will use 2x leverage (which is the maximum I am comfortable with for swing trading given its corresponding liquidation price). To simplify I won't include fees in my calculations. I close out the trade after each theoretical price increase and use the profits to buy BTC.\n\nScenario 1: BTC doubles in price, and I will have 1.5 BTC instead of 1 BTC (if I just held my BTC).  \nScenario 2: BTC triples in price, and I will have 1.66 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  \nScenario 3: BTC quadruples in price, and I will have 1.75 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  \nMeanwhile, in fiat terms I will have made 1, 2 or 3 times (in scenarios 1 to 3, respectively) my inital btc investment (in USD) in profits. But I do not want fiat, I want Bitcoin. so for accumulating Bitcoin it is markedly less interesting than for making fiat gains. So it would make sense for me to only use this strategy if I invest the profits in something else than the underlying asset, like the stock market for instance.\n\nI am all-in on crypto and it would be good for me to diversify by investing in the stock market. In this case I think 2x leverage swing trading would be attractive, trying to exit at 2-3x current market price. But it is a lot less attractive reinvesting the profits into the underlying asset, BTC, given the diminishing returns.  \nPlease let me know if my analysis has been sound thus or if I am missing something. I would not be comfortable increasing my liquidation price as the BTC price goes up.\n\n\n\nEdit: the more I think about it, the more answers I think I am getting. Diminishing returns doesn't have to be a problem as long as Bitcoin outpaces, say the stock market, by roughly 2.5x (quick math). Given year on year historical growth records one would predict it will outpace the stock market by a far greater ratio so, actually, investing the leverage trade gains into Bitcoin will still be better than investing it into an asset like stocks.\n\nEdit 2 months later, probably no one will read this but just in case: do your due diligence. There was a lot I didn't know about and still don't. I haven't used leverage and discovered more drawbacks such as rebalancing. Leverage is for short term and people who know what they are doing.

The bull market starts about Sep 2015 and the ATH follows about 850 days later at the 2.214 retracement.\n\nIn the 2017 to 2021 cycle the final bear market capitulation was Nov 2018 (it dropped a bit further but Nov was the killer month), and the 0.786 was broken in Oct 2020 which is 700 days later (it was touched in Jun 2019 but pulled back). The bull market starts about Apr 2019 (the April Fool's day candle) and the ATH follows about 914 days later (so a bit longer).\n\n**But**, the top is lower, what happened? Covid19 happened. After the price crash in Mar 2020, price recovered, then the money printers started as governments round the world tried to fix the total cluster f\\*\\*k which were the pandemic lockdowns. The result was a whole lot of people ended up with surplus fiat - think the laptop classes with stimulus cheques or furlough payments, with much less opportunity to spend, and so on. So, pay off some debt, save some fiat, invest .... and take a punt on crypto, it's free money after all. When the bull market really took hold, a lot of retail was already way in profit, so much less FOMO.\n\nSo, what should the top have been? Well, it should have been over 200K: the 2.272 retracement is at 210K give-to-take.\n\nNow, lets look at the current cycle. The capitulation event is Jun 2022 (Terra/Luna collapse - the FTX crash is not the same), so the 0.786 retracement break should not have been until May 2024 - but it has happened, in Feb 2024.\n\nWell, rather than say \"this time is different on account of the ETFs\", which means two \"different\" events (Covid19 and the ETFs) lets apply Occam's Razor, and assume only one \"different\" event, namely the one that has already happened, Covid19. In that case, we adjust the 2021 to 2025 cycle retracement to set the top at 216K which would be the 2.272 retracement \"top\" on the prior cycle plus a bit. This looks about right, the 0.786 retracement is now at about 115K which looks plausible given the current momentum.\n\nIn that case, the next ATH will be around Jul 2015 (912 days from the capitulation) and at around 940K (the 2.272 retracement).\n\nSo, there you have it.

On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: “bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.” and “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto”.\n\nIn this post I want to focus on the SEC’s warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‘risky’. I couldn’t find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.\n\nAs a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of bitcoin vs tech stocks:\n\n1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever\n\n1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash\n\n1. The largest market cap loss\n\n1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently\n\nThis is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.\n\n**1. Worst Investment Possible: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zvbxSYz.png\n\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Price | End Price | $100 bought at top and sold at bottom was worth | ROI %\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | Nov-2008 | $35.35 | $12.37 | $35 | -65% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | Feb-2009 | $59.97 | $16.10 | $27 | -73% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $414.50 | $108.24 | $26 | -74% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | Oct-2022 | $382.76 | $92.60 | $24 | -76% |\n| Netflix | May-2011 | Aug-2012 | $39.00 | $8.00 | $21 | -79% |\n| Apple | Mar-2000 | Apr-2003 | $1.34 | $0.23 | $17 | -83% |\n| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | Sep-2002 | $5.58 | $0.70 | $13 | -87% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |\n| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | Nov-2011 | $26.48 | $2.33 | $9 | -91% |\n| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | Dec-2018 | $1,292.63 | $84.47 | $7 | -93% |\n| Amazon | Apr-1999 | Sep-2001 | $5.53 | $0.28 | $5 | -95% |\n| AMD | Jan-2006 | Sep-2015 | $42.01 | $1.65 | $4 | -96% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |\n\nThe worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‘least worst’ investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.\n\nIt is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin’s market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.\n\n\n**2. Worst Recent Investments: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Price | End Price | $100 bought at top and sold at bottom was worth | ROI %\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Apple | Dec-2021 | Dec-2022 | $182.13 | $125.87 | $69 | -31% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | Oct-2022 | $344.30 | $219.13 | $64 | -36% |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | Dec-2022 | $149.12 | $86.37 | $58 | -42% |\n| Amazon | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $188.11 | $81.69 | $43 | -57% |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | Sep-2022 | $346.47 | $119.46 | $34 | -66% |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $164.46 | $54.57 | $33 | -67% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $414.50 | $108.24 | $26 | -74% |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $64,158.12 | $15,883.16 | $25 | -75% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | Oct-2022 | $382.76 | $92.60 | $24 | -76% |\n| Netflix | Oct-2021 | Jun-2022 | $690.97 | $164.28 | $24 | -76% |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | Jul-2022 | $4,733.36 | $1,036.19 | $22 | -78% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |\n\nInstead of using data from an asset’s entire history, this table compares the worst investments possible during the most recent market crash. All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet. Bitcoin was the sixth worst asset and Ethereum was the third. This tells the same narrative that crypto investments can produce bad returns, but not necessarily much different from tech stocks.\n\n**3. Market Cap Loss: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gZ0bHUf.png\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Market Cap | End Market Cap | Value Destroyed\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Peloton | Jan-2021 | Feb-2024 | $48,341,000,000 | $1,665,600,000 | -$46,675,400,000 |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $195,524,200,000 | $90,305,100,000 | -$105,219,100,000 |\n| Zoom | Oct-2020 | Feb-2024 | $161,647,800,000 | $18,910,800,000 | -$142,737,000,000 |\n| Netflix | Jan-2022 | Nov-2022 | $729,473,500,000 | $313,861,300,000 | -$415,612,200,000 |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | Jul-2022 | $559,910,000,000 | $126,170,000,000 | -$433,740,000,000 |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $835,067,500,000 | $279,552,300,000 | -$555,515,200,000 |\n| Meta | Sep-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,077,535,300,000 | $235,749,200,000 | -$841,786,100,000 |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Jan-2023 | $1,235,155,400,000 | $341,353,000,000 | -$893,802,400,000 |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,210,000,000,000 | $305,020,000,000 | -$904,980,000,000 |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,997,397,915,765 | $1,076,770,529,999 | -$920,627,385,766 |\n| Microsoft | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $2,576,063,200,000 | $1,597,120,900,000 | -$978,942,300,000 |\n| Apple | Jan-2022 | Jan-2023 | $2,986,128,300,000 | $1,989,628,300,000 | -$996,500,000,000 |\n| Amazon | Jul-2021 | Dec-2022 | $1,875,751,400,000 | $847,145,400,000 | -$1,028,606,000,000 |\n\nTo avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.\n\nBy none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.\n\n**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** \n\nAll-time worst market crash comparison:\n\nAsset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |\n| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |\n| Apple | Mar-2000 | 1126 | -0.07% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |\n| Amazon | Apr-1999 | 884 | -0.11% |\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | 397 | -0.16% |\n| Netflix | May-2011 | 458 | -0.17% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |\n| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | 334 | -0.28% |\n| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |\n| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |\n\nBitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren’t making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin’s ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)\n\nMost recent market crash comparison:\n\nAsset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |\n| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |\n| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |\n| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |\n\nIn the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOut of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png\n\nLooking back at the SEC’s statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin’s volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC’s statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. \n\n**A Sidenote on Beta**\n\nBeta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‘the broader market’. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&amp;P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&amp;P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&amp;P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&amp;P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.\n\nAsset | Beta | Interpretation |\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Ethereum | 0.08 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |\n| Bitcoin | 0.20 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |\n| Microsoft | 0.95 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | 1.05 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Apple | 1.06 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Amazon | 1.12 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Netflix | 1.15 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Meta | 1.34 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Zoom | 1.36 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| AMD | 1.48 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Nvidia | 1.78 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Tesla | 1.95 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Peloton | 2.84 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |", "lang": null, "likes": 61, "replies": 27, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bd6k5n/bitcoin_vs_tech_stocks_is_bitcoin_really_as_risky/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

The bitcoin top has been breached at 67.8k, and if another big day it’ll be 68.9kish by Wednesday which will mark the absolute top.

Every indicator is screening this is the biggest bull trap possibly ever. Yes I get ETF’s are out and “this time is different” but remember as fast as retail and institutions buy they can sell. It is different per se in testing ATH before the halving, but the real bull market begins later this year. \n\nOnce the FED begins to cut rates this summer the market will drop and experience heavy volatility.

I’ve been researching bitcoin and this bitcoin halving cycle and came to some conclusions. \n\nCan someone play devils advocate or let me know if I’m wrong on any of these points? I know that there some veterans in this subreddit, and I’m hoping to get some other viewpoints to challenge my thesis: \n\n\n1. Nobody has ever lost money holding bitcoin for any rolling 4 year period \n\n2. In the last phase of each bull market cycle, bitcoin will have parabolic moves up, and then crashes hard, but never significantly goes below the all time high price of the last bull market cycle. For example, bitcoin reached an all time high of 65-70K in 2021, and then crashed 70-80% to around 16K in 2022 only for only a few weeks, but never stayed below the 20K all time high from 2017 for long. The 20K all time high from 2017 was basically the floor for the next cycle \n\nIf the 2021 high for bitcoin was 65-70K then that will be the floor for this bitcoin cycle. Bitcoin will have parabolic moves after this bitcoin halving event in April 2024, but after it inevitably reaches the next all time high and crashes it will not significantly fall under 65K. \nAnyone buying bitcoin at today’s prices will not lose money in the next Bear market and there’s still a large margin of safety \n\n3. What sets this bitcoin cycle apart from any other previous cycle is that SEC approved, regulated bitcoin spot ETFs exist now. Every previous cycle consisted of only retail investors, but now institutional investors have a regulated way to buy bitcoin. The institutional money should make bitcoin less volatile. \n\nAs bitcoin reaches higher and higher market caps we would also expect the price to be less volatile just like any maturing asset. \n\nThis bitcoin cycle or some future bitcoin cycle, people are going to expect bitcoin to eventually crash 70-80%, but bitcoin may only crash 20-40% due to institutional money and increasing adoption/awareness. When bitcoin only crashes 20-40% in the upcoming Bear markets then this will cause many traders to stumble, and will be validation for the bitcoin thesis as a mature asset \n\nAm I wrong on any of the three points above?

And, despite the initial drop we saw last week, I think that is what we're seeing. Are ETFs partially responsible for this? Yes. But what is the mechanism that's taking money from traders? I'm not so sure about this one, but I'm wondering about how Jane Street and other authorized participants (AP) are involved. \n\n## Jane Street's Influence\nThese ETFs aren't just numbers on a screen. They're being nudged and wiggled by the likes of Jane Street, the puppet masters of the ETF world. Recall that Sam Bankmanfried left Jane Street to create FTX, and recruited from Jane Street (including his \"CEO/GF\" of Alameda Research)\n\nhttps://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/\n\nJane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for multiple ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. In the context of Bitcoin ETFs, an authorized participant (AP) like Jane Street has several key responsibilities:\n\n#### Creation and Redemption of ETF Shares\nJane Street manages the process of creating and redeeming ETF shares. This involves handling the inflow and outflow of funds from the ETF, which is critical for maintaining the liquidity and stability of the ETF.\n\n#### Overseeing Cash Transfers\nAs an AP, Jane Street oversees the transfer of cash to and from the ETF's administrator. This is a vital function for ensuring that the ETF operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n#### Market Liquidity Maintenance\nA significant part of an AP's role is to contribute to the liquidity of the ETF in the market. They do this by ensuring that the ETF shares are available for trading and by facilitating the process of share creation and redemption. As a result, Jane Street helps ETFs maintain a market price that is close to the net asset value.\n\n#### Interaction with Market Makers\nJane Street may interact with market makers to ensure that the ETF shares are traded at prices that are close to \"their actual value,\" further contributing to setting the market price.\n\n#### Fulfilling Investor Orders\nJane Street may create or redeem ETF shares in large blocks, known as creation units, which are then exchanged with the ETF for baskets of underlying assets or the equivalent value in cash.\n\nJane Street's expertise and experience in trading and market-making, especially in the ETF domain, make them a key player in the operational mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs. Their role is integral to the smooth functioning of these ETFs, ensuring that they reflect the price movements of Bitcoin while offering a regulated, stock-exchange-listed investment vehicle for Bitcoin exposure.\n\n#### Does Jane Street control both sides of the trade?\nIf you look into Jane Street, you know that their focus is on gaming the market to extract maximum value for themselves and they're making a huge amount of money somewhere. If being an AP for ETFs were not providing an ungodly amount of profit, they would not be involved. Also, remember that Jane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for *multiple* ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. READ, the buy side and sell side are the same entity, **regardless of which ETF you are buying with**.\n\n\n## The Bigger Picture: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe ETFs' story is a starting gun for a new era in crypto, turning Bitcoin into a blue-chip investment. We're talking about a potential influx of $50 billion or more this year alone. almost 100,000 bitcoin have been taken off the market already. And with Bitcoin's market cap hovering over $913 billion, these ETFs will add extreme bullish pressure to the price in the last two quarters of this year.\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis isn't just about numbers and charts (and assholes). It's about a seismic shift in the crypto universe. The ETFs are reshaping how we think about Bitcoin and its kin. Are we creating a new mental model about a market that's maturing, evolving--unpredictable as ever (but also, maybe, a little more stable)?\n\n## What's next?\n\nOnly time will tell, but one thing's for sure: the crypto market will never be controlled by unprofessional hacks, slinging private keys around on a web server, again.\n\nGood hunting.\n\nhttps://www.moonmath.win/", "lang": null, "likes": 41, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/19bh3v3/major_moon_math_update_jane_street_and_the_great/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

This is my primer on the potential Bitcoin ETF approval, found in my newsletter.\n\nOn Wednesday the SEC is widely expected to accept a number of Bitcoin ETF’s - which would allow stock mark funds to directly access the Digital Gold without having to deal with crypto exchanges. In the run up to this deadline, BTC has seen some volatile action, spiking in either direction amid conflicting reports; (a) On Wednesday 3rd January, Matrixport projected that the SEC would reject all applications - and cautioned traders to hedge long exposure. (b) On Friday 5th January, Bloomberg reported that applicants had cleared a key hurdle and is on path for SEC approval. (c) At pixel time, market sentiment is pointing towards an approval for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n**SCENARIOS:**\n\nThere are a number of different scenarios that could potentially occur. (1) All 11 applicants receive approval - a “fee war” may ensue, with funds looking to gain market share. (2) All 11 applicants get rejected - previous rejections have occurred on the basis that Crypto is vulnerable to fraud. (3) Some applicants receive approval, whilst others are rejected - some may not have met guidelines.Note: Scenario summary from WSJ piece found here.\n\n**Sell the news event?**\n\nWith BTC having gained over 50% in the past 6 months (+6%) this past month, many have suggested that the ETF news has been priced in by the markets already - with some analysts pointing towards this being a “sell the news” event. On the other hand, experts have pointed towards favourable technicals alongside strong momentum to support a bullish move post-approval.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My opinion?** In terms of the scenarios listed above; (2) would no doubt, be disastrous for Crypto, and would be indicative of a continued lack of confidence in the space. (1) expect volatility to occur in either direction - may well jump on approval and proceed to a marked sell-off, the opposite is also possible. I think the former will occur. (3) offers long-term catalysts for traders - some may see it as “more work to do / more approvals to be optimistic about”.\n\n**PIXEL TIME**\n\nFfs! As I wind down for the day with a scroll on Twitter, I find that the SEC X/Twitter account was hacked and subsequently made an announcement that Bitcoin ETF’s were approved. To make clear, this is false, no approval has been made yet. For reference, large Twitter accounts have been running with “ETF rejected” - which is not the case.In an immediate reaction to the initial tweet (which was assumed as fact) Bitcoin jumped from $46.7k to $47.8k; before then paring the entire move dipping to lows of $44.9k after the SEC announced it was hacked.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "18li2oy", "author": "blatchcorn", "handle": "blatchcorn", "created_utc": 1702929864.0, "text": "Here is my thesis why Bitcoin is undervalued relative to gold Cast your mind back to mid-October. The price of Bitcoin was $27K, bulls were waiting for confirmation of a spot ETF, and bears were waiting for one last capitulation. Since then the price has increased +55% to $42K at the time of writing; the price briefly hit $44k in early December. The price rally was driven by rumours that the SEC will confirm the spot ETF - they actually delayed the decision to Q1 24 - and speculation that the FED will reduce interest rates. Regardless of whether you are a bull or a bear, everyone trading or investing in Bitcoin wants to know: what is Bitcoin really worth?\n\nOne way to estimate the true value of Bitcoin is to benchmark it against something else. Bitcoin is commonly compared to Gold. This post will estimate the true value of Bitcoin by using Gold as a benchmark. Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, has completed the first step of benchmarking Bitcoin vs Gold by comparing the fundamentals. See [this link](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/bitcoin-first.pdf) and comparison chart below. The conclusion is that as a store of value, Bitcoin is better or equal to gold in six out of seven characteristics. Gold beats bitcoin for a longer track record. Overall I agree with their assessment. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WN1aASj.png\n\nTo estimate the true value of Bitcoin, we need to build upon Fidelity’s work. One weakness of this comparison chart is that some categories are more important than others. I have assigned an importance to each category below. This is subjective. Someone could make it more objective, but it would make the analysis more painstaking to complete and I don’t think my importance ratings will be majorly controversial anyway. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/n2M1WZV.png\n\nThe largest consequence of my importance ratings is that Gold is going to get a favourable comparison vs Bitcoin for winning the ‘track record’ category which has 65% importance. I think that is cautiously fair. The largest advantage of Gold is that it has been used as a store of value for over 2,500 years and I think track record is an important characteristic for most investors. Crypto investors evidently don’t care about track record, but outside of crypto a lot of investors do care. I have avoided making any dubious assumptions that benefit Bitcoin in this benchmarking analysis. I would prefer to make a confident estimate that ‘Bitcoin is worth at least X’ instead of a dubious claim that ‘Maybe Bitcoin could be worth up to X’. For example, I think I have been harsh on Bitcoin to say that ‘verifiable’ only has a 14% importance. This is an important characteristic and Bitcoin is much more verifiable than Gold. So my end calculation will under-value Bitcoin if you agree verifiable is actually more important than 14%.\n\nNext I want to quantify the exact difference between Bitcoin and Gold given Fidelity’s ratings and my importance ratings. The first step is to assign arbitrary points for each category. The winner of a category gets 100 points, the loser gets zero points, and for a draw both Bitcoin and gold get 50 points each. Here is how the results look:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UOa7Vu0.png\n\n\nBitcoin investors might be shouting ‘Stop the count!’ at this point because Bitcoin looks like a better store of value than Gold. But we have not considered the importance of each category just yet. Gold is going to perform much better once we factor in the importance of ‘track record’. To consider category importance, I calculated a weighted score by multiplying the points by importance. The results are shown below.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vcZrqfA.png\n\nBitcoin scores 26 vs gold 74 after we consider the importance of each category. This result is more meaningful if you put it into a percentage: Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold as a store of value (26/74 = 35%). This 35% is a key figure that will be used to value Bitcoin in the remainder of this post. If you disagree with 35% that’s fine, you can replicate the steps below with a different figure. For example, if you think Bitcoin is half as good as Gold, you can use 50%. To estimate the value of one bitcoin we need to gather the remaining inputs for our calculation: (Market cap of Gold * % used for investing *  35%) / supply of bitcoin.\n\nAccording to [Infinite Market Cap](https://8marketcap.com/), the market cap of Gold is $13.7 trillion. The small print mentions that the market cap is the total value mined. What we are interested in is the market cap of Gold used for investing because that is the market Bitcoin is trying to capture. Bitcoin can’t be used for jewellery. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Monetary_use): “The world's consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewellery, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry”. The exact percentages are debated because Gold reserves are not regularly audited (if at all). A few [other sources](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/gold-market-primer-market-size-and-structure) tend to gravitate around a 40% figure. So we will stick with 40%. Lastly there is a maximum of 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. Not all Bitcoin has been mined yet, and some has been lost. But I will use 21 million to err on the side of a pessimistic estimate.\n\nPut this all together and you can estimate the value of one bitcoin as ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.\n\nI like this analysis for three reasons. (1) It is based on the value of Gold which is a moving target and Bitcoin has a real opportunity to capture some of this market. (2) The assumptions are pretty ‘safe’. I think the biggest underlying assumption is the belief that if Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold it should also be worth 35% of the addressable market. (3) It passes the ‘eyeball test’. The logic makes sense and the end result is a believable number.\n\nIf someone wanted to, they could also repeat this process for other markets that Bitcoin could capture. For example Bitcoin might partly capture market share of the reserve currency market cap or the real estate investment market cap. Then you could add the Gold benchmark + reserve currency benchmark + real estate market benchmark to have a final number.\n\nFor now, I am content believing that one bitcoin is worth $92K which could deliver a 119% ROI for anyone buying at the current market price.\n\nBtw, if anyone wants a minimalist website to track the price of bitcoin over the next bull market cycle, I made [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com/)\n\nTLDR:\n\nValuation calculation vs gold =\n(market cap of gold * percentage used for investing * percentage of market bitcoin should capture) / supply of bitcoin\n\n= ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 7, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18li2oy/here_is_my_thesis_why_bitcoin_is_undervalued/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

One could pick a different month or number of months before the halving date, or the low since the last halving.\nAlso, this doesn’t take into account other functions that Bitcoin may fulfill in time. Standard of money. Increasing use as a currency. Endless possibilities. These could and likely would increase bitcoin’s value further. \nIn the year after the first halving in July 2012, price went from around $2.32 in December 2011 to $190 in April 2013. 82x. 10.5M btc were mined 50%\nAfter the second halving price went from $396 in December 2015 to $19720 in December of 2017, 49x. 15.75M btc had been mined. 75% \n3rd, $7200 December 2019-$68,000 in November 2021. 9x 18.375M bitcoin mined. 87.5%\nAs we approach the next halving in April 2024, we are around $44,000. 93.75% of Bitcoin will have been mined. \nAs you can see, after each halving the price goes up, but less so after each subsequent event. \nPlotting each ATH against the % mined is only meaningful on a logarithmic scale. If X axis is % mined and Y axis is price in log, one sees a rather straight line up and to the right. \nThis is where I am out of my water. I’m searching on excel to find a formula that would express the relation of the ATH log-10 versus the % of Bitcoin mined. Eyeballing a rough log-10 graph, it appears to be in the range of $200,000. \nThe other item O noticed when plotting these numbers is that the movement along the X or % mined axis are getting closer and closer together. So even though the ATH increases logarithmically, the increasingly smaller movement along the C axis limits the corresponding result on the Y axis. \nAs we know, this halving will progress until the last whole bitcoin is mined. \nFor the mathematical experts in the sub please take this from here.  \nThanks.", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18f56l0/does_anyone_know_how_to_plot_numbers_on_a_log10/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

All the plots are at:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Ybq4Z69](https://imgur.com/a/Ybq4Z69)\n\nPart 1:  BTC 4-Year Price Ratios\n\nI have BTC price data going back to Aug 2011, so I have 4-Y price ratios from Aug 2015.  Chart 1 shows BTC price, the 4-year price ratio, and the 1-year median of the 4-Y ratio.  For a little over 4 years (mid 2017 to late 2021) the 4-year ratio varied between 10x and 50x.  When the blow-off top never materialized after the 2020 halving, the 4-year ratio fell into a new, lower range.  Chart 2 shows the same data, but with the ratio plotted on a linear scale instead of log.\n\nChart 3 is a close-up of this new range (2.5x - 7x).  This new range is just under 2 years old.  The previous range held for 4 years, what if this range holds for another 2?  That leads us to Chart 4.\n\nChart 4 BTC plots 2.5x (green) and 7x (red) the price 4 years earlier against the current price. Looking out 2 years, it suggests  a BTC price between $80K and $200K.\n\nPart 2: 50-D /200-D SMA Crosses\n\nChart 5 shows BTC price (black), the 50-D SMA (orange), and the 200-D SMA (red).  In addition, I've plotted the non-dimensional 50/200 gap (\\[50D - 200D\\]/200D) in blue.  Ratio peaks corresponding to cycle tops are marked with black stars (I'm treating the first of the two peaks in 2021 as the top for this analysis).\n\nAfter the late 2013 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It briefly broke positive twice (1 &amp; 2) , then broke positive and stayed positive all the way through to the 2017 peak (3).\n\nAfter the late 2017 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It first broke positive for a longer time than the previous cycle  (1) , then again for a very short time (2) similar to the previous cycle.  It then broke positive and stayed positive all the way through to the 2021 peak (3).\n\nAfter the late 2021 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It broke positive for a period between the prior cycles  (1) , then again for a longer period (2).  A few days ago, it broke positive for the third time since the last cycle top (3).\n\nAlso of interest is the bottoming of the gap below -0.3, marked with orange.  This has happened three times.  The first two times were excellent entry points.\n\nUPDATE\n\nTGI Chartday!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TdLHef5](https://imgur.com/a/TdLHef5)\n\nHow much not-going-upness could we see before we should be worried?  \n\nChart 1 is BTC price after cycle tops, normalized to Nov 2021 prices.  The price has conformed to the ranges of the past two cycles fairly well so far.  The price could be flat for the next 10 months and still be echoing the past.\n\nChart 2 is BTC price, the 13-W (91-D) SMA, and the ratio of the price to the 13-W.  In sustained, non-parabolic moves up, the ratio tends to go between 1.0 and 1.3 (highlighted).  In parabolic moves, the ratio stays above 1.3, sometimes going as high at 1.8+.  The ratio is currently 1.244.  The 13-W is $28.1K and climbing about $55/day.  \n\nChart 3 shows BTC price and its 4-Y SMA, as well as the block reward and its 4-Y SMA. BTC is currently further above its 4-Y than any time in more than a year, which is also the case with the block reward.  BTC's 4-Y SMA is currently $27.6K.\n\nWhat do I do with all of this?  I put in a set-and-forget buy a little above $29K, and another a little above $30K.

Here are some of the lessons/observations I learned:\n\n1. Bitcoin/crypto (to me it was just bitcoin) was the wild west of trading and that comes with a ton of risk and opportunity. The risk is you have your money in the wrong spot, it can disappear without any wrongdoing on your part--counterparty risk. I had my money on MtGox briefly but thankfully I moved it to Bitfinex b/c BFX had leverage. Back then BFX was a nascent exchange ran by one French guy in his basement and it had a lot of glitches--for example btc would trade at $80 and I could get executed at $20 with some crafty order placement. Didn't happen often but I made a few thousand risk-free just with these print through executions.  Nowadays bitcoin isn't nearly as thin or volatile and exchanges aren't glitchy -- I  don't/can't trade it the same way because I don't have the same edges.\n2. I thought most \"btc investors\" were just dreamers/cultists back then. This gave me the mental flexibility to trade bitcoin without getting too attached. Little did I know, the \"dream\" would become very, very real with bitcoin going over $10,000 in 2017 and over 50,000 in 2020. While my returns as a trader are pretty solid, they don't come close to the returns of someone who simply held bitcoin at the time I first started trading it with serious risk at $250. That's ok though, I have no regrets. And I've actually become a believer myself, holding a few coins as a buy/hold investor.\n3. I come from a very active trading background. I day trade stocks on a short timeframe, back then even a micro timeframe where I'd hold for 10-20 minutes max on my scalps. I tried to apply this strategy to bitcoin by scalping very harsh dips and selling into the rallies and it worked but it was extremely stressful. The scalping setup equivalent of bitcoin might take an entire day to play out and that's an entire day of monitoring the market depth and price. I'd often take my laptop everywhere and set alarms at night, which at the time there was only one--a site called bitcoinity where it played the Darth Vader NOOOOOOOOOOOO soundbite from Revenge of the Sith. That shit was a nightmare.\n\nAnyway, I've been writing about my adventures in trading and just wrote about my 2013 experience trading bitcoin in this post: [https://churningandburning.com/2023/10/bitcoin-ii-the-no-awakens.html](https://churningandburning.com/2023/10/bitcoin-ii-the-no-awakens.html) \\--  I met an executive at BitInstant (almost got to invest with Charlie Shrem before he got arrested!) via another friend on my desk and we both traded 400 bitcoins in October 2013. We ended up outperforming buy/hold on bitcoin (for that given timeframe) by 4x magnitude through a combination of active trading (scalping 20-25% dips using leverage) and lending out USD on bitfinex. Needless to say I lost a lot of sleep.\n\nHoping for another bull market soon!\n\n(here's my first post on bitcoin, trading it from the $50 to $250 move in early 2013, if anyone wants to read it: https://churningandburning.com/2023/08/bitcoin.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "lang": null, "likes": 31, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/17feaxh/bitcoin_10_years_ago_crossing_the_1000_mark/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

At current price, the amount of new money flowing in to keep price at equilibrium is roughly $24 million per day to offset the newly created supply.\n\nAsset managers for spot ETF applications submitted currently have around $17 trillion in assets under management. Suppose just 1% of that allocation flows into BTC upon approval, that would be $170 billion. Now suppose that $170 billion comes in gradually over the course of 4 years to reach just that 1% allocation. That would equate to an average of $116 million in new money pouring in every single day. That’s nearly 5x as much as the amount needed to keep current price at equilibrium at current block reward. Once the halving occurs next year, it’s nearly 10x as much as the amount needed to keep current price at equilibrium. This is just assuming a 1% allocation from these fund managers reached over the course of 4 years.\n\nWith odds of a spot ETF approval being higher than ever in light of recent developments, there’s a very real possibility that we will get a spot ETF approved at least 3 months before BTC’s halving in April where new supply issuance schedule will drop to 450 newly mined BTC per day. So, with potential for an enormous wave of previously sidelined demand hitting the market you should really take this into consideration if you haven’t already: what happens if BTC reaches a new ATH BEFORE the halving for the first time ever?\n\nPredictable 4 year cycles effectively go out the window if/when that happens at least for a halving or two. Spot ETF approval potentially marks the beginning of the vertical part of S curve adoption as fund managers spend the next several years trying to get to their target portfolio allocation, whatever that percentage amount ends up being. Additionally, [futures are pricing in rate cuts from the Fed to begin by middle of next year.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)\n\nWe basically have a perfect storm trifecta of demand shock, supply shock, and favorable monetary policy scheduled to arrive within a short window of time of one another. I sincerely hope everyone here is using this time wisely as it becomes increasingly likely that we won’t be able to buy at these price levels for much longer and once we finally leave this range of $24.7-$31.8k that we’ve been stuck in for 7 months now, we’re never seeing these prices ever again.", "lang": null, "likes": 131, "replies": 116, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/178fqve/mathematical_implications_of_spot_etf_approval/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Everybody knows what Bitcoin is. Moreover, almost everyone is familiar with its background, that’s why I am not going to share any info about the pizzas, blockchain, crypto exchanges and other stuff that everybody has probably already heard about or can google it in a few seconds.\n\nI’ve been surfing the Internet for interesting crypto articles and found one that seems to be pretty provocative considering the religion and crypto mixed together in it. In this post I will briefly talk about the points.\n\nNowadays cryptocurrency and blockchain are the most popular matter of discussion in the world. If you are a regular to different crypto forums and media resources, you could eventually notice that Bitcoin has gathered a whole crowd of enthusiasts, or to be more precise, adepts, thinking it can be a real religion.\n\n* **Lorcan Roche Kelly** from Bloomberg, a financial news provider, has said that BTC is “the first true religion of the 21st century.”. Also, **Hass McCook** called himself a Bitcoin Evangelist and “The Friar”. He has also written a few Medium posts comparing crypto to religion.\n* The **Church of Bitcoin** was created in 2017. Its followers consider Satoshi Nakamoto to be their prophet.\n* In Texas, there is an advertising campaign with huge billboards saying **“In crypto we trust”, “Crypto is real”** etc.\n\n**What does BTC have in common with religion?**\n\nI can’t really define what religion is because it’s something that has no official scientific meaning explained in the dictionary. All in all, religion is a summary of cultural ideas and doctrines which are related to life, death, and God interpretations. Usually, these depend on the origin countries.\n\nConsidering this, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency do not contain any of these topics which leads us to a logical conclusion — neither Bitcoin nor any other crypto are not connected to religion by no means.\n\n**So why would people claim that BTC is a whole separate religion?**\n\nSome, like Hass McCook, are using the religion terminology to emphasize some Bitcoin cultural aspects and make middlemen get used to them.\n\nFor instance, “stacking sats” (that’s when users purchase small pieces of Bitcoins) sounds strange. But McCook talks about the religious ritual while giving this process another name — “tithing”, used to call the little donations from members in order to support their church.\n\nSo, in this situation, the word actually makes the action sound good and principled.\n\nAdditionally, some Bitcoiners think that BTC is not only the way to make money but also the ultimate answer to all people’s problems. “Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.” Such an attitude might be the reason for comparing BTC with religion.\n\n**In view of the foregoing, do you think cryptocurrency is related to a religious theme, and could Bitcoin become a new religion that solves all of humanity’s problems? If yes, why? Or why not?**", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 25, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/vtc09a/in_crypto_we_trust_or_is_bitcoin_a_religion/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Just adding some opinions to the discourse. Read at your own risk.\n\n\nThe volume we've seen drive down the BTC price is largely institutional traders treating BTC as a speculative asset to make a quick buck in a low interest environment. They quickly dumped their coins in an escape to fiat. The consequence of this dump scared new retailers into selling their coins.\n\nHowever, I imagine the institutions are surprised BTC's price hasn't fallen further. The legion of long term holders that never sell and continue to accumulate is at an all time high. This army of plebs is supporting the price and is unlikely to capitulate under any circumstance (almost).\n\nWhat we're all waiting for is the next leg down after a big dump by whales. This could be the final catalyst before finding the floor. I'm not well versed to the impact from leveraged long and short traders but I've read longs are piling in at record levels. The cascading effect of these liquidations may also be a force to drive price down.\n\nGive it a few months and I believe we'll reach the absolute bottom. My prediction is we'll see $19-22k. This will be the load zone for whales and wall street to re-enter. It may also be the point that some diamond hands show they are not quite strong as presumed. I hope not but the fear it's going to $6k will shake some. Don't fall into this category! Don't be the sell side of the whale buying!\n\nSimultaneous to this price movement, we have layer 2 applications being rapidly developed by top tier teams and individuals. Additionally, we have regulations and revised accounting standards close to being deployed. The stage will be perfectly set for new explosive growth and price movement. By the end of 2022, the price will have recovered to $45k.\n\nWith the stage set and the macro economy stabilizing, a new tidal wave of money will enter the space. This wave will crash everyone's expectations and usher in the next era of BTC. We will quickly see the price rise above $100k by the end of 2023. This momentum's effect on price will strengthen with the aide of the next halving. We will never see another 70% drawdown on BTC's price. We'll reach the $100k+ level and start to stabilize - waiting for the next era that will be even more exciting. I think we'll eventually see $180k in this period.\n\nAnyone that buys now at $30k, will 3-6X their investment by 2024. Anyone that buys at $18-22k will 6-9X their investment. Anyone that ultimately capitulates at $19k, will buy back at $45k.\n\nGood luck ya'll and keep at it!", "lang": null, "likes": 12, "replies": 39, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/uubb1h/my_observations_and_price_predictions/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

However, this has me wondering, what about the average Joe?\n\nThe retail investors that have an actual interest in cryptocurrencies, those that believe in the technology and want to utilize it for its intended purpose; i.e. BTC as a decentralized store of value and payment currency, don't have millions to purchase BTC like institutions.\n\nAs institutions hold billions in BTC, it keeps the buying pressure up, but what if they sell and it causes a large dip in BTC? Institutions can manipulate the market however they want, causing retail to panic sell and then buy back BTC at a lower price. And as BTC falls, other projects that have good fundamentals like Plastiks or Link, they will fall too. And these institutions also include CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, FTX, etc that can see your orders.\n\nTheoretically, a billionaire corporation can buy billions worth of BTC, driving the price up and leaving less supply for the entire world.\n\nIn short, institutional interest in crypto is a part of mass adoption, but it will almost certainly negatively impact the average investor that's in cryptos for the technology.", "lang": null, "likes": 37, "replies": 56, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/u5gy8k/institutions_are_buying_in_huge_amounts_wondering/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I figured I would do an update on my ongoing crypto audit.  **This is long.**\n\nThis applies ONLY to the US.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is MY Experience.  No doubt there are others who know better.  This is advice from someone who really fucked up and is paying dearly for that.  Don't be ME.  Crypto was new in 2017.  I did a lot of poorly though out and kind of \"reckless beyond sense\" things with bitcoin, Etherium, ICOs and every other shitcoin available at the time.\n\n**The TL/DR is, you better have ALL of your details.  Going back to your first trade.  You are NOT smarter than the IRS.**\n\n\\-------------------\n\n Some quick background: \n\nThis audit is on my 2017 taxes.  I received a request for back-up information that was due on August 26th 2019.  I went through my records and reconstructed everything I could find.  I knew i was missing some...but I did not think it would matter.  Silly me.\n\nOf course I waited until the last minute to do the work.  I had a couple other things on my mind.\n\nIt just so happened that August 26 was the day of my wife's Whipple Surgery for pancreatic cancer and it was the day my mom died after being in hospice for 3 weeks.  Literally, the worst day of my life.\n\nNeedless to say, I \"effed\" up the reply and that triggered a real anal probe of a review.  My review indicated I should get a 5 figure refund.  And they paid it. \n\nThen, they looked closer.  Boy...was I wrong.\n\n The amount of detail they have gone into over the past two year has been amazing.  I discovered I was using incorrect thinking about cost basis.  And when I realized that, I knew I was screwed. \n\n I have been fully cooperating--which is good because they are going to be quick to play the \"evasion\" card.  I actually paid a big bill going into the review to acknowledge I screwed up.  They got paid back their refund...and then a lot.\n\n They went through every transaction on my Coinbase, Trezor, [Gate.io](https://Gate.io), Bittrex, and a couple of MEW wallets.  Ever.  From the first day I traded bitcoin in May 2013. \n\nEvery move, every buy, every sale.  Now, keep in mind we are talking the big run of 2017, BCH drops, ETH trades and a bunch of ICOs.  There are about 1400 transactions, but then you need to account for every move OUT of one wallet to another.  If you can tie them together, there is no impact.  But if you sent stuff out to other addresses and you cannot identify it and establish where it was...its a sale.\n\n So, here is how its going.  After two years and some pretty intense discussions (all of it amicable), it has come to pass that the IRS has engaged a third party vendor they use to calculate cost basis and capital gains.  This third party will take the ledger files of all of your wallets and combine them into a single transaction list.  They will calculate your cost basis and taxable income.  The IRS will present this to me.  Then we can \"discuss.\"\n\n Now, here are some important things to note:  I had two Bitcoin Q wallets (large and small.) at the very start of my BTC life.  One I called the \"large\" wallet.  The other the small wallet.  One had a couple of large deposits from bulk buys and sales.  Not a big deal.  I actually had those records.  It took a week to download the blockchain...but I ended up with the detail.\n\nThe \"small\" wallet had hundreds of small transactions.  When I got my trezor, I moved everything to the trezor and never gave this \"small\" wallet any thought.  It now sits on a broken hard drive or lost USB drive.  I've torn my home apart looking for it.  That stupid little wallet is going to be the death of me.  There are no coins in the wallet, but there ARE hundreds of transfers all around to and from the wallet that I cannot \"prove.\"\n\nObviously, tying a sale to a specific purchase is easy.  You subtract one from the other...and the difference is your gain or loss.  Easy Peasy.  Just make sure you can do that and account for every single move you have every made in your crypto life.\n\n**Every time I sent something out of the wallet and I cannot tie to a real sale, or an exchange for good (like a financial Report) is considered a sale.** That taxable income is based on the cost basis--and these little sales will change every cost basis from 2016 to 2022.  It screws up thousands of transactions. \n\n**Every time you get bitcoin or any other crypto coming into your account and you cannot account for the purchase, it is assumed that the income crypto is INCOME.**  And that is the cost of the unit for your cost basis.\n\nThose two things added up to tens of thousands in \"capital gains\" AND \"income\" they say haven't been reported.  We've whittled away at that number....but its still bigger than I want it to be.\n\nThroughout the process I have been asked such \"rookie\" questions such as, \"When you move crypto from wallet to wallet in a Trezor, do you pay a commission or pay a network fee?\"  Scary, huh?\n\nMy point is that some of the people you will be dealing with have little or no experience with this process.  Years ago I was audited for a small business and at least the examiner and I \"spoke\" the same language--we might have have disagreed, but at least I understood where he was coming from--and he knew what I was saying.  No so with Crypto.  They have specialists who are always in training.  Listen to what they asking to verify that its even \"correct.\"  My examiner and I actually had some laughs over their \"crypto ignorance.\"\n\nIts like laughing with the Lion about to eat you.\n\n So...these guys are backed up against the wall.  I signed two extensions--some lasting a year because they were backed up with cases.  And these are the examiners--not the folks doing to tax return back ups. \n\nPart of this is because they NEED to give you six months after your findings to appeal.  And you need at least a full year of \"active examination\" for the appeal to proceed.  They don’t have the staff and they don’t have the time to do this stuff swiftly. \n\nThe downside to that is if they are up against the wall, they will go with their first blush—and that was really, really wrong.\n\n Since I know I am screwed, and I paid more of what I am going to owe...I signed.  And now this can go until Dec 2022. \n\n But, my advice for everyone is to do the following:\n\n**Its not what you know, or think about what you did...its about what you can prove.**\n\n Print out the account report for ALL of your exchanges.  All of your exchanges going back to your first transaction.  Put them in a safe place.\n\n Print out the history of each of your wallets.  Even if you think no one will ever find it.  They will.\n\n List out everything you've bought with bitcoin.  Because that purchase price is going to be a sale.  If you sent it to an address...they are going to identify that address.  When I did my report I just said I bought \"gold\" or financial reports with it.  The gold I have receipts for.  The financial reports...not so much.  They haven't pressed me on  that stuff because they were minor.\n\n The ICOs bought were a pain in the ass because a lot of them were on MetaMask and it would take a fortune to go back rebuild those.  I kept pretty good records of the follow on sales, so that won't be horrible.  But I would have loved to have the records.\n\n If you did any kiosk and peer to peer exchanges, they will want the details.  Names, Dates, etc.\n\nAs best you can, tie one transaction to the next in a daisy chain.  They understand network fees so if you can show you sent 2 of this to a wallet, and then sent it to another wallet..they understand that.  But you have to be able to tie them together and prove it.  This is tough when you aggregate in an off line wallet, and then send them to a single address to sell.\n\nIf you did a lot of trading (say on Coinbase and Robinhood) it can be maddening.\n\n **Do no lie to them.   Never use NEVER or ALWAYS when describing anything to them.**\n\n**Do not ignore their letters.  They don't \"ask\" multiple times.  They will write a couple of times.  Then it will come certified mail.  Then they will toss a lien on your bank account and house.  (THAT did not happen, but I've heard stories.)**\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I've told them, \"I think that's it\"...and then i found a place where I did four or five \"one-off\" transactions that cleared up about $6k in taxable transactions (which was good.)  But, I had to go back and say, \"look what I found.\"  On a couple occasions they've come back and said, \"What was this...we cannot find it anywhere else.  It looks like it went to ‘”Fill in the blank exchange.”  And there I am standing with my pants down.  I had no memory of making that transaction 5 years ago.\n\n If  you are using a third party vendor to assess transactions, make sure you include ALL of your wallets and all moves, transfers, and transactions since Day 1.  Do not assume if you are using a Trezor for some stuff, a Ledger for another, and Coinbase for other stuff that simply linking your API to Coinbase is going to be good enough.  Its not.  They want it all.\n\nEven though their examination will be for a specific year...they will ask to see cost basis.  In my case they cannot go back further to taxable income because the statute time has lapsed.  But, the \"cost basis\" they come up with will affect hundreds of transactions from 2017 through 2022.\n\nThey will expect a \"re-file\" of transactions for those tax years.  Even this year, their finding will likely impact the cost basis for some crypto traded in 2021.  This means I get an extension now or I will literally have to refile in May or June.\n\n The tiny good news is that during this process I found residual tidbits of ETH and Bitcoin in a few small wallets.  Was amounted to $5 in 2017 is considerably more today.  So I was able to pick up a couple hundred dollars. LOL\n\n The process has been frustrating, maddening, and enlightening.  The examining agent and I have become \"friendly.\"  They are wonderful people working for an entirely inept bureaucracy.  While I have gotten my digs in here and there, I guess I have been worn down to being a compliant worker bee.\n\n**You are not smarter than the IRS.  If you watched Ozark and think you can move money around in the US without them seeing it or finding it...you are wrong.  Don't try doing that.**\n\n**Don't lie.  If you are in this situation, suck it up and deal with them.  Get help if you need it.  DO. NOT.LIE.**\n\n They will come at you…not this year, but in 1 to 2 years or later.  They are that backed up.  They will ask for a whole range of detail.  If you do not provide it, with cross references or updates, they will nail you.  That is where it becomes scary.\n\n If anyone lives in the US and they find you have done any dealing in Crypto and you do not “check the box” on the Tax form they will come down hard on you.  Don’t do that.  They told me that is the first thing they will cross reference.\n\nSo, after two years I've finally submitted every note, spreadsheet, download, or report that I can find displaying my crypto history.  There are no more Merlin Cryto secrets.  They have it all.  Its up to their Wizards.\n\nThey will come back with a number that I can negotiate, dispute, or appeal.  I am pretty sure I won't have the money or inclination to fight this further.  I can pay their fine, get Jussie'd out of \"IRS jail\" and get on with my life.  When someone in your family has PC, you do not dwell on shit.  Even when its been gone for two years.\n\n The only thing that makes me smile is the knowledge that somewhere there are a bunch of college kids who made $50k in Dogecoin last year.  Or Shiba.  And they either blew it on Spring Break or they tried to hide it (They watch too much Ozark.). And these kids are going to have to claim that revenue on their Taxes, their parent’s taxes, and their FAFSA.  Financial Aid will get dropped.  And parents will be on the hook for their kids taxes…AND their own modest tax rate could get bumped up to another rate.  \n\nThat might be fun to watch as I emerge on the other end of the IRS colon\n\nMy best advice is be very careful.  Be honest.  And be prepared to show you work...just like a 7th grade algebra test.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.  I will do my best to answer them.

The 10 year negative rate rose from -1.17 to -0.73 and BTC fell from \\~68,000 to $41,800 so far....an almost exact match of about 37.6% and 38% respectively. 10-year nominal rates are expected to reach 2% to 2.25% which - while inflation remains high (assuming it doesn't change at all) will put the real rate yields near -0.49 to -0.24.  Worst case scenario that we can predict is -1.17 to -0.24 or about 20.5% meaning BTC can reach $13,940 down from $68,000. \n\nI ran the numbers for February 2021 lowest rate and March 2021 highest rate, and correlated it to the drop in price as well.\n\nReal rate yields changed 53.7% and BTC changed 48.1%.\n\nI don't know why the timing was skewed but I figured it might have to do with massive FOMO and retailers and exuberance.\n\nThe latest rally was more sobering and concentrated to professionals so it dropped more timely and more precisely.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 17, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ryk657/btc_13900_is_possible/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

It was removed because it mentions \"shitcoins\".  I'm not sure how that subreddit can pretend to have any meaningful discourse while simultaneously labeling everything else in the cryptocurrency industry as a \"shitcoin\".  To me it further shows that Bitcoin investors are using more of a faith-based approach versus a pragmatic approach.**  \n\nI'd like to outline my thesis on Bitcoin for 2022 and beyond. I have been involved in BTC for a long time and I have been very bullish on the network in the past. However, I don't believe in falling in love with an asset. I believe in constantly reviewing your thesis, since the industry and environment are highly dynamic.\n\nSo, here are my criticisms on BTC and why I think it will underperform in the short/mid term:\n\n* Bitcoin Network lacks the maneuverability to implement changes &amp; new technology. This is for several reasons.  \n\n   * First, the network's strength is its longevity and security. We are very careful for any modifications we make to the network as a whole, because we worry that any change could bring in a vulnerability. For that reason, BTC network is very slow to implement updates and changes tend to be very minor.\n   * Second, BTC is decentralized and has no specific organization cemented as leaders. Therefore, simple changes are often disputed and have even resulted in forking the community. The creator of BTC is an anonymous person who hasn't appeared in a decade. Therefore, there is no voice of leadership, which could provide concrete direction.\n   * Third, Bitcoin was of course the first network ever launched. Therefore, it is based on the most simple, albeit functional, technology. It lacks smart contract support and requires a second layer for any type of feasible scaling.\n* Lightning Network has been too slow to gain adoption. Competing networks have already leapfrogged Bitcoin in terms of second layer solutions and real usage.  \n\n   * We cannot deny that Ethereum has made big strides on their implementation of Layer 2 technology. There are multiple forms of layer 2's which are all competing and building out projects. ZK-rollups, optimistic rollups, hybrid solutions. I went to a talk on Lightning Network in 2015. Today, it's still very under-utilized.\n* Blockchain Payments are better solved with stablecoins.  \n\n   * Like it or not, BTC and other floating value cryptocurrencies are volatile. Volatility is the enemy of currency. Currency is meant to be stable, the price of an item should not change within 10 minutes of making a purchase. Commerce is still overwhelmingly done in USD and other fiat currencies. Adding a secondary currency to the mix simply complicates transactions. Further, BTC's high value creates awkward payment amounts which are difficult to understand at a quick glance. For example, it's very confusing to convert 0.000025 BTC to USD. It's much easier to convert something like 100,000 VND to USD, even though it has similarly high digits.\n   * Stablecoins are quickly displacing BTC and other cryptocurrencies in payments. This trend is not showing any sign of deceleration.\n   * Please spare me the inflation argument. Inflation in the USD was very low over the past decade. It is obviously much higher today, but the Fed is reacting and controlling inflation is part of their mandate. Further, 5% or even 10% inflation isn't enough to justify BTC price hitting $100K or beyond.\n* Confirmations are too slow for payments  \n\n   * Payments need to be verified near-instantaneously. It is not acceptable to wait 10+ minutes for 1 confirmation.\n* BTC's primary function is as a store of value. Its value is derived from scarcity and demand. When it was the only game in town, and when it was the only project anyone was using, that was enough. However, today there are projects gaining major traction, all of which offer similar forms of scarcity. Digital scarcity is constant in some form throughout the industry. Therefore, it is not enough to warrant being the top project by itself.\n* Other projects are showing up with real useful technology. DeFi seems most relevant at the moment. Blockchain gaming seems to be gaining traction as well. NFT's are very hype-y but long term, their application outside the art world has great potential. BTC has no way to really get involved with these new use cases. It is pigeon holed into payments / single asset network.\n\nSo there you have it. I'm sure you'll be tempted to tell me I'm an asshole, since you are probably a BTC investor. But I'd really love to hear your critical responses to my concerns. I would love to see Bitcoin succeed and continue to dominate the market. I just don't see how to get excited about the project as it is today, especially compared to its peers.", "lang": null, "likes": 4, "replies": 155, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ry9o8y/my_bitcoin_thesis_2022_and_beyond/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Wishing you all the best at this time of the year.\n\nFirst, thank you for all the good stuff you bring to this thread, and making it the best place on the net to discuss Bitcoin insights.\n\nThen, I would like to give back some of my own thoughts of the recent months. I'm very interested in getting your feeback.\nI was not sure whether it should be a separate post / thread or not. Anyway, here it goes.\n\nLike others have said, looking at the minute or even daily moves of the price is futile. Interesting, like a soap drama is, but futile.\n\nSo now that we're at the end of the 4 year cycle, or rather what used to be the 4 year cycle (more ahead), is a good time to try to get the bigger picture and take a look ahead where the price might go in the next cycle.\n\nHowever, predicting price is fun, but there are very few chances that predicted prices actually happen in the predicted way. Rather, what is easier to be predicted are the successsive trends the price will take. And what is actually truly useful is to outline the big underlaying principles that will make them happen.\n\nLet's first take a look backwards. 4 years ago, at the end of the previous cycle, I thought I had nailed it and understood how price would move : more or less like 4 years earlier. This proved mostly correct throughout 2018... except that we had a descending triangle rather than a descending channel. Why ? because bottoms were skimmed.\n\nThis \"small\" change made a big difference at the end of the year, were the price dropped a cliff and got halved from 6k to 3k. And an even bigger difference in the first half of 2019, when this sudden drop gave birth to the complementary opposite reaction : a rally all the way up to 14k. I think it's fair to say that this rally suprised most people, and at least that such a 4 year bear market rally was unprecedented in the whole history of Bitcoin. However, looking back, all of this looks now rather consistent and logical ; rounded bottoms and tops have become the norm rather than the exception, as is the increased RELATIVE volatility of the price even though within less large bounds.\n\nAll of this is nothing new, but this gives us a good overview of how new big trends have increasingly hanged the historical behaviour of Bitcoin, and what are the \"new\" - actually, rather \"updated\" - principles behind price moves. So here they are.\n\nHistorical trends remain :\n\n- price staying within historical regressions. I'm very fond of the one where the bottom line doubles, and the top one increases by half every year. It was a 3k- end of 2017, is now at 25-100k, and will be at 400-500k end of the next cycle (end of 2025). This tightening also shows that soon after or before that, it will have to break, probably down since the bottom line is more unsustainable long term (26000k in 10 years !!). Besides, tops getting skimmed means that we'll probably never see again the upper limits of it.\n- impact of halving every 4 year. However I'm NOT saying that we'll still get a mind-blowing blow-off top after.\n- well known price patterns will repeat... until they are broken. Same for short term and longer term trendlines.\n- Bitcoin price, like all markets, always does the most unexpected move, in order to take money from the majority.\n\nBut they are been modified by big trends such as institutional adoption &amp; ETFs :\n\n- institutional money is big and plays like in other markets to get their share : they use futures to skim off tops and bottoms, making them rounded. So now more blow-off, 80% drop or deep dip with V shaped recovery (black swan like Covid crash being the exception)\n- institutional money wants volatility, so they take advantage of rounded tops and bottoms to push the price in the other direction more than it would be without them.\n- institutional money wants yearly returns, so there is an increased chance that every year will have some kind of \"incredible\" rally, even cycle bear market years, such as the 2019 one.\n- I'd go on a limb and say that institutional money like an appealing product, so if they can get a new high every year they will.\n\nNow that we've got the big principles nailed down, let's use them to draw what would be a possible evolution of the price in the upcoming 4 year cycle. Again, this is the part that is the most fun, but the less useful. Don't trade on these prices, Bitcoin always does the unexpected, and trends will keep on changing. However, it shows how to use the big principles to get a picture of what might come, and have a steadier hand at the helm.\n\n2022 :\n\n- right now, it is plausible to say that what happend in the April-July bear repeats. So after a short relieve (that just happened, up to 52k), price will contine going down sideways, down to 45k up to mid-February. Moreover, institutional money first needs time to get a position again for further 2022 rallies. Yes, China selling pressure will end, but that's not going have an impact on day one.\n\n- Then my idea is that it will be much like the 2018 rally to 10k, because the rally to 12k first only happend because of the 70% drop, which we won't have. we will have a retest of 53k that will first fail, but then succeed in a rally further up ending in May (2 months earlier than last time, like everything seems to happen). And then \"sell in May and go away\". Institutional money needs a nice rally to get their earnings in 2022. Maybe it'll end at 65k, with everyone being dead sure that anyway it'll end only 2k higher (so 71k) ? But it will be a good opportunity to trick them into FOMOing at the top, with the \"extended cycle\" talks. In this case, the new ATH will be defined by a new upper line. A good one is the one going through the 2017 and 2021 tops, which triples every 3 years or so, is now at 70k, at 210k end of 2024 and 1900k end of 2030. This line would define a new ATH at 82k in May.\n\n- then price will at first make people believe price will go to 100k (at last !) and there won't be a 4 year bear market anymore. But whales will milk all these \"100k is next door\" new converts. So still no 100k then. And it will actually break the big trend lines up that remain, probably at 60k start of August, and drop down to 40k or even 30k start of September 2022. BTW, 100k can only happen once everybody is disillusioned and thinks that new attempts are pointless. What made me doubt of 100k end of 2021 was all these \"300k blow-off top\" predictions at the start of the year, like 100k would be a sure thing.\n\n- there it will be all doom and gloom, and people will expect the price to get halved down (like end 2018) to 20k or even 15k, but it most probably won't happen - actually, can't happen anymore. Bear market length went down from 6-9 months in 2014 to 4-6 months in 2018, depending on how bounds are drawn, so this time it would be 2.7-4 months. So it would end before the end of the year, and the price would go back up to 50k, where lies the big trend line and the lower line of the historical regression. Except if institutional money needs more time to get their position at the start of 2023 ; then everybody would fear the big trend line and regression are broken, but I think whales will have more interest in milking their fears and in the end push the price back up. But who knows.\n\n- What's more interesting is that if and when it were to break down, it would have to find support and another trend line to later follow up. The simplest one is a parallel one drawn from the Covid drop bottom, and it merely always sits 25% below it ; it also was a support in the 2015 bear market. 25% lower is not bad, but it still ends up at 300k end of 2025. Another one goes through the 3k and the Covid drop bottoms ; it sat at 5k start of 2020, will be at 40k start of 2025 so gets *8 every 5 years and will be at 320k in 3030. But I think this one is premature at this moment. It will get its time in the limelight, but probably not for years to come.\n\n2023 :\n\n- from there, it seems logical we'll have a big rally, born of the big bear market dip, much like in 2019. Except that back then, 20k hadn't been a skimmed off top, but a blow off top. Note that if 100k has been skimmed to 69k, 20k would have been skimmed down to 14k incidentally ! Where up to ? at least 70k as we've just seen. But I believe that we'll rather see a new high. It is counterintuitive (which is good for whales) at this time of the cycle, but it is the logical conclusion of the \"blow-off top skimming\" principle. And all the more if we didn't get a new ATH in 2022, because then 70k would already be a new ATH, so it will draw a lot of attention. I'll even wager that it'll take 100k, up to 105-140k on said new upper trend line made of the 2017 and 2021 tops. This is where institutional money will get their earnings this year.\n\n- then the price might only fall. I don't know where to or when, maybe the previous 60k tops, repeating this year's pattern of halving down abruptly - again, \"sell in May and go away\". But to follow the regression's bottom line, it has to be above 100k at end of 2023. Will it again ? or will it cling a new bottom line, the one 25% below at 75k ? or free fall to find a new support down, and make everyone fear that the halving effect is gone for good ?\n\nFrom then on :\n\n- in 2024 we'll have the perennial halving short term rally, If it's again 2 months earlier, it'll be too early for institutional money to get their earnings from it, so there would be another rally later that year (after a drop where they can build their position), ending in September. If the price did cling to said trend line, at least one of those would make a new high, up to 170-250k on said trend line.\n\n- now, what's interesting is that at this time and at this price, said 20k-60k tops trend line makes an ascending triangle with the regression's lower bound. So it now has to break. Up or down ? I don't know. My heart says up, in this case up to 240-500k in 2025, but most probably the fabled 300-350k. Indeed, 300k is the previous cycle tops trend line. And 350k is the 70% skimmed off the regression's 500k upper line. But 300k is also the \"25% below\" lower trend line, which means that we would have had to broke it down earlier and find new support. So maybe this time we would have broken it end of 2024 in a catastrophic manner, that would still allow for an institutional money-desired rally in 2025, but with 2025 being still already full cycle bear market. This would be bad for the morale, so maybe it would have broken down earlier, and we would have had a halving rally and post halving rally worth of the name, as in the good old times. In any way, this shows the limits of the exercise, which has now come to an end.\n\nFinally, looking back at this scenario :\n\n- I admit that a new ATH every year is a little bit rosy, like never again going below 40k or 30k even. But so much depends on what will happen by then.\n- next cycle's ATH will very probably be between 240k (previous cycle tops trend line end of 2024, at 300k end of 2025) and 350k (70% of the regression's upper line end of 2025).\n- following an upper line &gt; 300k in 4 years means doing *4, which is more than what the price has done in the current cycle up to now. So I think that there's margin for a new ATH before that, so in the first half of either 2022 or 2023.\n- but beware, long term support lines are far and few below...", "lang": null, "likes": 45, "replies": 130, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/rs7kkc/next_4_years_bitcoin_price_trends_and_predictions/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Here are the recap and observations from our team:\n \nQUICK TAKEAWAYS:\n\nBitcoin declined nearly 20% overnight as the weak price action to end the week extended overnight into a less liquid weekend session. The effects were even more severe on offshore exchanges like Huobi, where bitcoin hit $28,800 at its lowest point.\n\n\n$1.1B of leveraged BTC positions and $2.5B of crypto leveraged positions (including bitcoin) have been liquidated in the past 24 hours.

I want to help other traders (or aspiring traders) get more comfortable with this and learn how to move in this market. I post some setups on reddit, but working on moving myself to a public server so others can get more of my charts and I can help those that are interested.*\n\nOne of the questions or topics I get asked the most is about how to remain level headed when making trades. Of course, this only applies to people that are buying and selling; DCA and HODL strategies are not impacted by this.\n\nMany people have different strategies for how to manage this, but hopefully by providing mine it will help some of those that don't even know where to start. I struggled with this for a long time before I found my strategy and got comfortable with it.\n\nThe two main pieces for me are actually having a plan before making a trade and being confident on my entries to trades. And you HAVE to stick to the plan, too many people say they have a plan but deep down they know that the plan is not flushed out or complete and so they don't follow it.\n\nThe hardest part of this strategy is starting it, once you start it's easy to maintain. Reason for that is you need to wait for the proper entry and sitting on the sidelines is hard for some people because they feel they always need to be in a trade. But the name of the game is to chart any of the coins of interest, I chart BTC and have support/resistance levels and good patterns drawn on all of my charts. I have heavy support levels marked on the charts and in all of the places where you'd thing \"dang, it would be awesome in this pulled back here\". And I mark those levels on a ton of coins I'm interested and I set alerts at or near those levels.\n\nAnd this is the hard part, you wait. Wait for those good entry levels to get hit. If the entire market pumps hard and new levels are reached, I adjust the levels on my charts accordingly but still don't buy in until they are hit. The entire goal here is to buy when the price is on its way down or sideways, not the way up.\n\nAnd then it happens, a market correction or small dip to correct longs occurs. And those targets start to get hit, I start to get alerts that the prices are closing towards my targets. And I scale into them slowly, in the event that the dip goes beyond my targets and I can get an even sweeter price. I do this in a distributed fashion across some of the coins that I'm most interested in and feel they will have best bounce up (this can be based on coin news coming out soon or technical patterns that are stronger than others).\n\nBecause I enter on confidence at those levels, I don't have to worry about the endless dip. I know that if the prices continue to dump below the technical patterns I have drawn, I sell because the pattern I set up for failed. Sure I took a small loss, but we are generally talking no more than 5-7%, not the 40%+ many others take in altcoins. Then we re-analyze the charts with the next support levels, and enter again on those levels because a correction to the upside is bound to be soon if our first targets got demolished. (There are better ways to expect the next bounce support levels, this can be determined by charting BTC with the altcoins of interest; just wanted to clarify it's not randomly done at every support level).\n\nThen the market starts to do it's correction back to the upside. Even if not a big or rapid correction, I am almost immediately in profit because I entered on support. So doing that negatives almost all of the negative/sad emotions of crypto because I ride almost no downtrends, and if I do its very short term. And now we use our charts to look at where the overhead resistance levels will be, we can chart and get an idea of when to expect a pullback or correction in the market. And when I think that correction is around the corner, I sell my holdings. Depending on the market and charting, I will do this in portions as certain resistance levels or targets are reached. I have to know to be happy with my profits.\n\nWhile that uptrend is happening and I am just letting my setups play out, I continue to chart and scope out my next moves. Planning for that next correction or swing downward already. So while I take my profit and wait, I have the game plan already in motion so there are no rush decisions. And as I sit on the sidelines, its a perfect time to reflect on any mistakes I might have made if something didn't go right or learn other technical concepts, etc.", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 78, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/qwdvfq/riskminimization_selfdiscipline/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Bitcoin is almost always either just repeating a pattern it has recently made, mirroring a pattern its made, or flipping the pattern its recently made. That sounds like a lot of possibilities but when you start getting into the weeds you can see where it can occasionally help.\n\nObviously, I cannot tell the future, but I am using a real-time example here for demonstration. This analysis will be 2 parts; the first part showing a pattern bitcoin made recently on 3hr timeframe. And the second part showing a potential repeating pattern happening on 1 hr timeframe.\n\n[BTC 3hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qi0vYAuK/) the main thing to look at here is the section with 3 green triangles. Bitcoin is constantly printing these, it leads to a ton of head and shoulder type of patterns, but they arent always perfectly horizontal (for example the one I am showing is slanted on an angle).\n\nNow if we zoom in to the [BTC 1hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbiIYRbf/) we can find an almost identical formation. These aren't perfectly shaped which can make them more difficult to spot. But there is a chance that we get a repeating pattern and bitcoin is about to have a nice little run again.\n\nI'm not saying I am a fortune teller, but patterns like this show up and play out all the time. You guys always criticize that I never provide any \"predictions\" on my posts and the answer is because predictions are dumb and impossible. But I'm putting it out there now because this is a speculative idea I am currently running with and would love to see if it plays out or doesnt.\n\nRegardless of how it turns out, I would like any other traders or charters to try and back test this idea to see how often it actually works out.

The thread explores Timmer's unique price-performance model. In [THIS](https://mobile.twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1382026394541174787?s=09) thread Timmer suggests that the S2F model is unidimensional, and a model incorporating demand may yield more accurate results.\n  \nHis research suggests that BTC demand thus far has closely followed that of cell phone demand. Timmer extrapolated this logarithmic relationship based on historic BTC data and mapped it against the S2F model. The result is [THIS](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ey3w1DNXEAgz2ZW?format=jpg&amp;name=small) figure which presents a bracketed price model based on the 2 variables.\n  \nThis model suggests an EOY price bracketed by $37.6k (demand) and $98k (S2F). As a long-term holder, I appreciate what I perceive to be a more sensible and subdued approach to price prediction versus those circulating in most BTC circles. The lower bottom end of Timmer's model may be seen as bearish by some. However, I suspect that the bottom end is fairly conservative based on recent market price action which suggests consolidation in the '60s. Ultimately, I view his model as a positive and productive contribution to better understanding BTC price action moving forward.\n\nBeyond the model, I believe it is extremely bullish for BTC to receive analysis as a high-performance asset from this longstanding and reputable TradFi institution.

BTC and BTC.D confluence, have a plan in place! I'm always preaching to find confluence between charts for market moves. And this doesn't always work perfectly, but it is such an edge to this market that most traders do not see.\n\nWe are able to time some really big moves out of Bitcoin by doing some basic technical analysis on bitcoin dominance. And [BTC.D](https://www.tradingview.com/x/926xkxkA/) is currently nearing the end of a really step falling wedge, and we love wedges because they come to an apex.   \n\\*\\*REMEMBER: Bitcoin Dominance does not tell us the direction of a big move, just preludes that a big move may be coming\\*\\*\n\nSo the next step is to look at the Bitcoin chart. [Bitcoin 1hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eRa5xj6B/) shows us that Bitcoin has been in a falling channel since it broke a new all time high. And this makes sense because Bitcoin has needed to cool off and reset funding rates.\n\nStatistically speaking, both of those patterns should break higher, but they could also break lower and it's important to have a plan in place for all scenarios. So here are the 4 scenarios and how they each play out differently.\n\n1. BTC.D and BTC both break higher : Bitcoin breaks higher from the falling channel, the bitcoin rally begins, and BTC.D is increasing because FOMO is driving new money into the market and Bitcoin is pumping like an altcoin\n2. BTC.D and BTC both break lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks lower, most altcoin will remain stable, with few big gainers.\n3. BTC.D breaks higher, BTC breaks lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks higher, all altcoins will get wrecked. When bitcoin goes down and bitcoin dominance goes up, there is blood is the streets.\n4. BTC.D breaks lower, BTC breaks higher : This is a market euphoria scenario. Almost all coins are green, tons of double digit green altcoins. Almost no way to lose in this scenario unless you are late to the party and FOMO at the top.\n\nBut notice that there are only 2 charts here, and we can at least paint some pictures for possibilities. It's important to plan for each scenario because the last thing you want is to wake up in the morning, check your coins to realize your entire portfolio has dropped a zero, and hope that emotion-filled you is going to make the right choice in that moment. You need to check the plan you said you were sticking to, and follow it.\n\nHappy trading!

Just wanted to point out a very basic bullish idea. The all time high of the crypto market has been broken and in the last day the all time high has been retested absolutely perfectly. This is a wonderful sign for the market in the near future. Its such simple basic ideas like this Support/Resistance flip with a valid retest that will make so much more money in crypto than the fancy, overcomplex analysis. It's also very possible that we will retest this level a couple more times soon but the important thing to know is that it will provide good support. If you haven't read between the lines yet, I'll make it obvious: If we get a pullback and the Total market cap pulls back to that support, its a perfect time to consider opening positions. But you need more than this one idea, I'll come back to this in a second.\n\nAnd for the sake of teaching, it's always good to have confluence between multiple ideas. Here is my [USDT Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z14x4MMu/) chart I shared a few days ago saying we had to keep an eye on this double bottom. The support level I have had drawn had a perfect breakout and retest, and this matched our ideas with the Total chart above. Again, confirms the bullish sentiment in the market.\n\n[Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/akSRW2cC/) is quickly approaching the neckline of the double bottom. Keep in mine, where I put the neckline may not be exact, but there is definitely a resistance zone in that area.  \nAnd a [Bitcoin 2hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jea6hA2A/) chart to compliment the BTC.D chart. A couple days ago I mentioned an upward break of a rising channel is mega bullish. Turns out that was the case, and it even gave us an iconic retest. That formed another rising channel earlier today and that even broke higher and now we are headed to ATH. I'm mostly showing this to display where resistance levels may be for those traders that are looking for small dips to buy in. I extended the rising channels because those will provide support in the event of pullbacks. And all of the dashed purple lines in the background will provide support as well. I even left my alert line on the chart because I'm a nice guy :)\n\nAnd now we have to tie it all together. I mentioned I would come back to an idea I mentioned in the first paragraph. Find confluence between multiple ideas! Don't buy just because the TOTAL chart cane back to support, that doesnt mean your particular coin of interest is done dropping (maybe yours didnt even pullback!) Find support levels on the coin you want to buy, wait for the pullbacks to line up between the TOTAL (TOTAL2 and TOTAL3 are good too depending on the coin of interest). Look at the BTC.D chart and find its resistance and support. Buy in on confluence and you will not lose!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions welcome.

And always do things in scaled intervals, I mentioned before to scale into Bitcoin on any pullbacks and retests, and it happens that we just so happen to be retesting the rising channel. Here is a zoomed in [Bitcoin chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iUD7Ir5q/). Look at a couple older posts to see other potential support levels for buying in.\n\nAnd [Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oZmfkj6w/) is at a breaking point. Being squeezed between overhead resistance and a rising channel. Remember that dominance does not tell us the direction of the move, but it does warn us when something is about to happen. Odds are heavily stacked that this will break downward (because rising channels break downward most often AND because this overhead resistance has been tested FOUR TIMES in less than a week).\n\nBTC.D trending down is often an indicator for good altcoin trading, but because the market is so overextended, and it's likely we see some short term bad news for bitcoin (any single ETF not passing), its most likely that an entire market correction would happen, which would mean bitcoin pulls back and altcoins get dragged down hard with it. \n\nMy strategy is always that if odds aren't heavily in my favor, then I'm not trading. So for these reasons, I'm sitting on the sidelines right now.\n\nQuestions welcome.", "lang": null, "likes": 25, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/qa0817/bitcoin_etfs_fomo_things_im_watching_as_we_go/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

In fact, I strongly discourage most people to use derivatives as they are leveraged investments and can easily go against you and result in losses that go beyond what you have in your trading account. The risk is even greater with highly volatile investments like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Furthermore, derivatives require a very active management and quickly become time consuming. Studies have shown that simple buy and hold - HODL! - strategies have systematically outperformed derivative investments and I strongly recommend that this is what the majority of people should do. However, even if one is not investing in options, they can be really useful tools to interpret what the market may or may not do and the idea here is to exchange views and opinions and these interpretations. I’m also writing this just as much for myself as for anyone else as it helps me keep track of my investment process and gain valuable insight from others’ opinions. If this might be of interest read on. If not please skip this post and rest assured that HODLing is much safer and more lucrative than trading options.)\n\n**Follow up**\n\nI posted a couple of days ago a trade idea which you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pj9sz7/option_trade_idea_sell_bitcoin_50k_covered_call/). I wanted to put on this trade because my feeling was that we had reached a ceiling with the 52k level and while I still wanted to benefit from some upside if we kept on rallying I also wanted to protect my BTC investment from a pullback which I felt could come from some negative regulatory scrutiny. My target trading range was 45k / 55k.\n\nLow and behold BTC took a severe beating a few hours later due to the negative news from the SEC taking interest in the Coinbase lending program. Luck must have been on my side because I couldn’t have possibly timed this if I had wanted to - in fact that’s why I chose a medium term 60 DTE maturity for the trade as I didn’t expect the correction to come so soon.\n\nBy selling the 50k BTC Oct21 Calls on Wednesday we collected 0.15 btc ($7.8k) of premium and at time of writing they are trading around 0.1 ($4.5k) therefore locking in a 0.05 ($2.3k) unrealized profit from the decrease in the value of the option. However, since this is a delta neutral trade the long delta hedge 0.5 btc per option has cost us around 0.06 btc ($3k) due to the 10% drop in the value of btc from 52k to 46k.\n\nAs intended this trade has mitigated our losses from the correction as the decrease in the value of the option has more or less compensated for the drop in the price of the underlying.\n\n**What now?**\n\nThere is still a fair amount of premium in the option therefore we are going to hold the position since the general consensus is that the market will not bounce back quickly and we are looking at a trading range of 40k / 50k for the weeks to come which means that theta decay will chip away at the value of the option netting us some additional profit.\n\nSince we remain bullish it might be a good time to purchase some additional spot since this will enable us to buy some “cheap” btc so we don’t miss out on the next rally while also counteracting the increase in premium of our short call position if the market does move up. That being said macro news may weigh on btc and crypto in general with Fed starts tapering in Q4 so we will be cautious in our btc spot purchase by averaging our buying.\n\n**Was this the best trade or would there have been better trades?**\n\nIn the initial post u/LoudOrganization6 suggested selling a 65k strike instead of the 50k. This would have been more suitable for someone more bullish than me and would have captured only 0.05 ($2.6k) btc of premium by selling the 65k call strike for the same expiry. The idea was to maximize the premium income which is why we opted for a slightly ITM call to match our short term bearish outlook.\n\nAnother combo by u/LoudOrganization6 would have been to sell a 60k strike Call (0.08 btc) and buy a 45k Put (0.7 btc) which is essentially a Collar. The sale of the Call would have paid for the purchase of the Put. At time of writing the 60k Call is now worth 0.04 btc and the Put 0.12 btc. With hindsight this would have been a much better trade than the Covered Call trade although it would have hurt a bit more in the short term if the market had kept on rallying with the increase in the premium of the call and the collected premium having been used up to pay for the long put.\n\nAs always tits jacked !", "lang": null, "likes": 15, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/plwfzd/follow_up_bitcoin_50k_covered_call_29_oct_2021/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I’m currently long 0.17 BTC (~$8.6k). Long term I am bullish on bitcoin and crypto in general. However, for the medium term (end of october) my feeling is that BTC is struggling to push through the 52k resistance level. Even if we do break out I don’t see us going any higher than the next 56k resistance level by the end of october. In fact, I think crypto will undergo some regulatory scrutiny during that period which will trigger a pull back to 45k maybe even 40k level.\n\nSo my problem is how do I protect my long position in case of a pull back while also capturing some of the upside?\n\nLet’s consider the following scenario if I do nothing and keep my position as is (I did some rounding for ease of reading) based on my current position 0.17 BTC (~$8.6k) \n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 52k = $8.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 55k = $8.6k + $0.4k = $9k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 60k = $8.6 + $1.4k = $10k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 45k = $8.6k - $2k = $6.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 40k = $8.6k - $1.2k = $7.4k\n\nAs we can see if the market rallies I capture some upside but I have a fair amount of downside risk as well.\n\nNow let’s consider selling 0.5 x 50k Call 29 Oct 2021 Expiry all things being equal (i.e. no change in volatility)\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 52k : pnl today 0 / pnl expiry $8.6k + $3k  = 11.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 55k : pnl today +$0.2k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $2.4k = 12k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 60k : pnl today -$0.8k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $1k = $9.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 45k : pnl today +$0.2k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $2.4k = $12k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 40k : pnl today 0 / pnl expiry $8.6k + $1k = $9.6k\n\nBest case scenario BTC stays within the 45k / 55k range and my profit is $2.4k. Even if we go much higher I would only start losing money if we go above 64k by the end of october. Likewise if we go much lower I would only start losing money if we got below 34k in that time period.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[screenshot of payout simulation](https://imgur.com/a/4Cm7qU4)", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 54, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pj9sz7/option_trade_idea_sell_bitcoin_50k_covered_call/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Today I decided to take a look at Bitcoin  (daily) as ETH took center stage yesterday and did a number on those  bears. Bitcoin decided it was going to follow last night and we  approached resistance. 50k... This 50k resistance is sure a thorn in the  side of the bulls. Speaking of resistance, ETH crushed the resistance  at 3600 which is likely the most recent catalyst to the current bullish  momentum. At least in my opinion.\n\nI see a  possible ascending right triangle pattern, which is generally considered  bullish. These patterns do not always break out as advertised so make  sure you set a stop loss.  There have been consistent higher lows  (bullish) recently and that makes up the bottom of the ascending  triangle. The top is marred by the resistance at 50k. Something's gotta  give. RSI is still low enough for us to break the resistance at 50k.  Time will tell if this comes to pass.   \n\n\nI am  going slightly off topic here to discuss stop losses on small cap  coins. I understand that sometimes some of you set a stop loss on  these  low cap coins. Then complain about how the stop losses do not trip  consistently. The likely reason for this is low liquidity is to blame.  If you dont have buyers then your stop loss won't trip. That is why I  prefer trading big cap coins like BTC or ETH. There is a reliable amount  of liquidity to trade with confidence in your stop loss. Just something  I wanted to discuss as I have noticed this pattern. People complain  about their stop not tripping. Even trading Bitcoin can result in  skipped stops. But it's much more rare due to the massive liquidity  Bitcoin possesses.

BTC formed a peak of about $48,245, and the price began to fall. It shattered the support levels of $47,500 and $47,000. \n\n**Coinbase BTC Outflow**\n\nData fom TBEN Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC/USD has hit lows of  $46,530on Bitstamp in one day. It is the lowest the coin has experienced since August 27.\n\nIt traded around the support area of $46,500 and formed a low area of about $46,540.  It is now consolidating the losses near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decrease from the $48,245 swing high to $46,540. Bitcoin is currently gaining again and trading at $47,686.71.\n\nFor Willy Woo, an analyst, who echoed this week’s findings, Bitcoin is likely to maintain a large pool of support in the current ranges.  BTC has a pricing base ranging from $45,000 to $50,000 for over 1.65 million of them.\n\nHe said on Twitter that Bitcoin is approaching a price stability region. The zone around $51,000 is set to crumble at the mid-level. It is a final obstacle level to Bitcoin. The timing for this is quite a mystery.\n\n**Investors See the Light**\n\nIn turn, investors seemed to go on the day with reserves on Coinbase recording the [lowest](https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-drop-1000/) since December 2017. There are only 700,000 BTC and about $20 billion in stablecoins in centralized trading platforms ready for exchange. During the May sell-off, there was quite some BTC inflow. Coinbase is currently experiencing a large outflow of coins, according to Glassnode.\n\nCointelegraph contributor Michael van de Poppe however, sees nothing much in the news. He insists that it is just business as usual for BTC as it goes through consolidation.\n\n**Ethereum is Rallying**\n\nEthereum formed a base for a sustained gain at $3,250 and began. The price of the ETH cleared the resistance levels of $3,350 and $3,380.\n\nIt even rose above the $3,400 zone and was significantly above the 100-hour average. Nearly $3,477 was established before a downside reversal took place. The price was lower than 3,400 dollars, but the bulls were active at around $3,350.\n\nOvernight ETH/USD exceeded $ 3,500, the highest over the US Dollar and the BTC in three months. Its cryptocurrency market cap dominance climbed to 20.4 percent, with bitcoin holding steady at 44 percent.\n\nSuccessful bulls could lead to larger gains than $3,480. The next biggest resistance is close to $3,500. Once crossed, it may lead to another break above the $3,500 resistance. Ether may rise to the level of $3,600 in the given instance.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-bitcoin-btc-since-2017/](https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-bitcoin-btc-since-2017/)", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pg6udp/coinbases_bitcoin_btc_outflow_highest_since/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I have the 4hr pulled up today for BTC and we can see  that we are clearly in consolidation at this point. That can be a good  thing or a bad thing depending on your positions. As we approach the end  of the triangle I drew I expect a move to occur. This could be just a  breather before the bulls recommence the rocket ride north. If the bears  win this triangle we can revisit 44k. 44k looks to be support. Albeit  minor support.   \n\n\nThe 200 MA lies below us at  around 45k. This is only the 4hr 200 MA so it is not quite as solid as  the daily 200 MA. But I still appreciate the reliability of the 200 MA.  Even on the 4hr time frame. The daily 200 MA is sitting just above the  4hr 200 MA at around 46k. So support is quite abundant and as a result  the bulls may pull another bull candle on us... No guarantees though so  set that stop loss traders.  \n\n\nI pointed out  the 100 EMA. Many people ask me why I mix Moving averages (MA's) and  Exponential moving averages (EMA's) and all I can really claim is  through rigorous time and effort reading charts on the regular I saw a  lot of reason to keep the 100 EMA in my repertoire. We can see it  clearly is support on the 4hr time frame anyways. One thing I noticed is  every time we test the 100 EMA we seem to go a bit more south in  relation to where the 100 EMA lies. With each test we drop just a bit  more. Just keep an eye on the 4hr 100 EMA as if we lose it I believe we  may just drop to approximately 44k...\n\nRight now  my best advice to play this pattern is to do what I do. Go long and set  a good stop loss. If we break up I get profit. If not my stop will trip  and I may lose a bit but I plan to make up for that on the bounce.

Fortunately enough, however, at the recently concluded ‘The B-Word’ conference, Musk said that Tesla would ‘most likely’ resume the bitcoin payments service soon.\n\nSimilarly, Wall Street giants have also been vying to add bitcoin to their list of offerings on the back of the rising demand from accredited investors and private clients.\n\nAs recently reported by BTCManager, Wells Fargo had filed for a passive bitcoin fund with the U.S. SEC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/institutional-bullish-bitcoin-btc-50000-resistance/](https://btcmanager.com/institutional-bullish-bitcoin-btc-50000-resistance/)", "lang": null, "likes": 26, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/p9o02w/rising_institutional_adoption_bullish_momentum/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Today I  decided to continue my look into BTC. I will do ETH again I promise.  Anyways, BTC did exactly as expected... We filled that bull gap as soon  as the close yesterday (pretty much) It wouldn't net you a trillion  dollars or anything but I always enjoy setting a winning trade at the  beginning of the week. Support held throughout the lower volume weekend.  But can it continue?\n\nWe are approaching a sort  of \"squeeze point\" which in essence is a place on the chart where the  candles become locked in (in this instance between ascending support and  the resistance at 48k). We have 2 factors I want to bring up. First of  all, RSI is very high. We should all know by now what that means  (bearish) but we also understand that the RSI is not very reliable on  its own. We also have the ascending right triangle pattern we are in  currently and from past experience these patterns are typically  considered bullish. But with RSI the way it is I highly recommend a stop  loss!\n\nWe have had 4 solid weekly closes. Each  candle was around a 6k gain give or take. The bulls seem intent on  taking us to the resistance around 50k but we need volume to get there.  Perhaps the bears strike? Don't lose hope. This is like a dance.  Sometimes the bulls lead. Sometimes the bears lead. If you can navigate  these changes you can make some decent profit bear or bull. The evidence  is right there on the charts folks!

What needs  to happen with this current candle is it needs to close above $45,220.  That is the current price I have my eyes on. That 200 MA is not going to  give up quietly and we really need to separate ourselves from the  support with a good green candle.\n\nBitcoin looks  great if you are a bull but I still recommend setting a stop loss.

We crept into the 46k range this  morning and I expect that the western hemisphere will wake up to a  collective sigh of relief. But there is still work to be done! I took  some time this morning to look into possible future resistance. And I  can see around 50k we see many instances of support and resistance so  that is the real next hurdle IMO. But we still have some ground to cover  in order to climb to 50k..\n\nRSI suggests a  possible pull back but with the recent developments (breaking of the 200  MA) the RSI may take a backseat to fomo buyers. As bullish as any of us  may be we still need to remember risk management is key to ensuring  your gains stay gains. As long as we remain above the 200 MA we are in  decent shape and it may take some time but RSI will catch up if we can  maintain these gains. The entire premise of the bull run not being over  begins with holding onto the recently gained 200 MA. IMO this is the  line in the sand. If it holds we are bullish. If we lose the 200 MA it's  not so bullish.   \n\n\nETH looks great and from a  technical standpoint ETH is more bullish than even BTC. But if a big  move up or down happens for either coin they will follow each other. The  ETH market cap is 40% of Bitcoin. That is significant. So yes I do  believe ETH can lead the pack.

Sources close to the bank have hinted that the fund, which is only available to clients of JPMorgan’s Private Bank, currently has no investors but the firm is seriously pitching the bitcoin investment vehicle to prospective investors, according to reports on August 5, 2021.\n\n**JPMorgan Delving Deeper into Bitcoin**\n\nAfter several months in the works, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, has finally launched its bitcoin (BTC) fund in a landmark move that shows the cryptocurrency ecosystem is gradually coming of age.\n\nPer sources close to the matter, the passively managed bitcoin fund was developed in collaboration with New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) and the team has made it clear that it will be available to only a select group of its wealthy clients.\n\nNotably, JPMorgan has described its new bitcoin investment offering as the safest and cheapest fund available on the private markets. The firm has also hinted that the fund may be converted to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) when the Securities and Exchange Commission finally starts greenlighting them.\n\n**Bitcoin’s Legitimacy Rising Steadily**\n\nJPMorgan’s complete transformation from being a totally bitcoin-averse financial institution to one that has now embraced the super volatile cryptocurrency with open arms goes a long way to show that the long-time rhetoric held by critics that bitcoin is just a tool for fraudsters, has lost its authenticity.\n\nEven JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in September 2017, described bitcoin (BTC) as a ‘fraud” destined to blow up, adding that “the currency isn’t going to work. “You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart. I would fire any of my workers trading bitcoin in a second, for two reasons: it is against our rules and they are stupid, and both are dangerous,” Dimon said at the time.\n\nMore recently, in March 2021, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [argued](https://btcmanager.com/blockchain-association-hold-talks-with-regulators-over-amenable-regulations/) that bitcoin poses immense danger to both the public and investors.\n\n&gt;“I don’t think that bitcoin …is widely used as a transaction mechanism. To the extent, it is used I fear it’s often for illicit finance. It’s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,” he said \n\nWith global institutional interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies steadily increasing, it is expected that the legitimacy of these innovative digital assets will continue to move in an upward trajectory.\n\nAt press time, the price of bitcoin ([BTC](https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-price/)) is sitting around $38,151, with a market cap of $715.24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nArticle: [https://btcmanager.com/jpmorgan-unveils-private-bitcoin-btc-fund-for-wealthy-investors/](https://btcmanager.com/jpmorgan-unveils-private-bitcoin-btc-fund-for-wealthy-investors/)", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/oythfi/jpmorgan_unveils_private_bitcoin_btc_fund_for/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Brazilian bitcoin miner Ray Nasser had posted on YouTube that his company was negotiating with Aramco to utilize excess energy produced by the Oil company to mine BTC. \n\n&gt;“We are negotiating with Aramco. All black liquid \\[oil\\] that comes out of the desert belongs to this company. All the flared gas they’re not using, and that’s public information, I can tell you, it’s enough to ‘power up’ half of the bitcoin network today, from this company alone,” he stated. \n\nAramco swiftly denied these claims in a statement issued on Monday.\n\n&gt;“With reference to recent reports claiming that the company will embark on bitcoin mining activities, Aramco confirms that these claims are completely false and inaccurate.”\n\nBitcoin mining requires a large amount of energy which Aramco has readily supply. The company produces a significant chunk of the world’s oil supply and can channel energy from the gas flaring process towards bitcoin mining with minimal operating costs. \n\nSome oil companies have looked to leverage this opportunity by using excess gas power to mine bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, an American mining company was reported to have shipped portable bitcoin mining equipment to oil and gas firms for mining activities. \n\n**Aramco and Blockchain Technology**\n\nAramco is no stranger to blockchain technology and currently deploys DLT within its system. It uses the technology within its supply management operation to standardize business processes and increase efficiency while reducing costs. \n\nIn addition, the oil giant has invested in two blockchain projects: Data Gumbo and VAKT that aims to develop management and automation of new contracts and invoices. This investment shows the company’s commitment to taking a foothold in the fast-growing blockchain industry. \n\nHowever, launching a bitcoin mining operation could be tricky giving the recent commitments of the Saudi oil company. Aramco revealed in 2019 that it was committed to achieving a zero net gas flaring operation by 2030.  Bitcoin mining has its controversies with energy consumption and it remains to be seen if the oil giant would be willing to reconsider its current stance in the future.\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/saudi-aramco-denies-reports-on-bitcoin-mining-activity/](https://btcmanager.com/saudi-aramco-denies-reports-on-bitcoin-mining-activity/)", "lang": null, "likes": 33, "replies": 25, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/owot02/saudi_aramco_denies_reports_on_bitcoin_mining/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Hi there,\n\nfor about 2 months I am using grind trading on Binance and Kucoin. On Kucoin I use a very wide range without leverage for the long term, on Binance I create rather narrow grids for the short term when I expect a time of sideways action, especially after strong price action. For these short-term Grids, I use \"high\" leverage, usually an x10.\n\nNow I was wondering what would happen in case of leveraging a wide grid for the long term (let's say BTC Grid range 22000 - 100.000, 149 steps, x10 leverage). How high would be the risk of liquidation in a grid with x10 leverage? I was playing around in excel and I am normally mathematical experienced but couldn't figure out how the risk of liquidation changes while running a grid. Is there a risk of liquidation at all due to the constant averaging down in the grid? And if there is a risk of liquidation, how could I calculate the amount of margin to avoid liquidation of my x10 futures?\n\nWould be happy to get some ideas from you. Or maybe someone already has experience in this approach.", "lang": null, "likes": 5, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/otwd5b/how_can_i_assess_the_risk_of_liquidation_in_wide/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}
