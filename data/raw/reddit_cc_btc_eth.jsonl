Spot XRP exchange-held reserves have fallen sharply, with estimates suggesting only around 1.5 billion XRP remain on trading platforms as of late December 2025. \n\nKey Insights\nSupply Dynamics: The supply of XRP on centralized exchanges has contracted significantly, a trend widely interpreted as a sign of institutional accumulation and long-term holding rather than active trading. Over $1.32 billion in XRP has left exchanges in one recent 30-day period alone.\nETF Performance: Spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. have attracted over $1.14 billion in cumulative net inflows since their launch in mid-November 2025, with several products recording continuous daily inflows. This contrasts with outflows seen in some Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs during the same period, suggesting a potential decoupling of XRP from broader market trends.\nMarket Sentiment: While consistent institutional inflows point to long-term confidence, the price has remained in a range-bound, weak pattern, leading some analysts to note a divergence between on-chain data and price action.\nPotential for Supply Shock: Analysts suggest that this imbalance between strong, persistent demand from ETFs and the rapidly decreasing supply on exchanges could lead to a significant supply shock by early 2026, potentially driving a major price movement if retail demand increases.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pz3k0q/day_of_recogning/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

EVM in two weeks. \n**Dusk (DUSK) quick summary — what they’re trying to accomplish (and why anyone should care)**\n\nDusk is building a **privacy-first, compliance-friendly L1** aimed at **regulated finance / RWAs** — basically: bring real-world financial instruments on-chain while keeping sensitive data confidential *and* still workable for institutions.\n\n**Core thesis**\n\n* Most chains are either “fully transparent DeFi” or “privacy at all costs.”\n* Dusk is trying to be **confidential + auditable + regulator-compatible** for things like securities issuance, trading, settlement, and compliant DeFi. ([dusk.network][1])\n\n**How they’re doing it (architecture)**\nDusk is moving to a **3-layer modular stack**:\n\n* **DuskDS** = consensus / data availability / settlement layer (foundation)\n* **DuskEVM** = EVM execution layer (Solidity + normal Ethereum tooling)\n* **DuskVM** = future privacy-focused VM layer (for heavier privacy apps) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\n**Why the EVM layer matters**\nDuskEVM is meant to reduce friction so devs can use **Hardhat/Foundry** and deploy Solidity contracts like on any EVM chain, while still settling to DuskDS. ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\nNotable quirks from their docs:\n\n* DuskEVM currently inherits a **“7-day finalization period”** (their wording) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n* **No public mempool** (transactions are only visible to the sequencer right now) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n* Docs list **Mainnet chain ID 744** + official RPC/explorer URLs (and note mainnet “Live: No” while testnet is live). ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\n**Institution angle / regulated rails**\nDusk is leaning hard into the “regulated edge” narrative via **NPEX** (a licensed Dutch trading venue), claiming it brings a suite of licenses into the stack and helps enable regulated issuance/trading/settlement. ([dusk.network][1])\nThey’ve also pushed interoperability/market-data standards via **Chainlink + NPEX** for regulated assets on-chain. ([PR Newswire][3])\nAnd there’s reporting on 21X (DLT Pilot Regime venue) collaborating with Dusk, with Dusk onboarding initially as a trade participant. ([Ledger Insights][4])\n\n**Timeline / catalyst**\n\n* Dusk shipped a **DuskDS L1 upgrade on Dec 10, 2025**, framed as the “final release before DuskEVM mainnet.” ([tradingview.com][5])\n* **EVM mainnet launch:** community/team chatter in Discord suggests it was “this month” then slipped **~2 weeks**.

Also, our own relationship with scarcity and its psychology. \n\nI preface this by saying there is no such thing as a perfect financial system at this juncture, the best hope is for more forward thinking humans that care deeply about sustainable futures, while also being wise about innovation and novelty.\n\nWith that said...\n\nI thought about the best metaphor that I can think of to get a sense of my current perspective.\n\nLets use sports and trading cards/jerseys. (I leaned towards using Michael Jordan as a metaphor, but I think Tom Brady fits better.)\n\nLets say that the National Footbal League underwent a massive scandal and lost much of its popularity and trust/viewership. The salary cap was becoming unsustainable to pay the star players and the demand was very uneven.\n\nTom Brady comes out of obscurity as a 6th round pick... Essentially undrafted for all intents and purposes of this example.\nThe NFL instituted that to draw more fans and network effect, they will be taking a game jersey for every player and will make tiny square patches to distribute in a limited supply trading card.\n\nTom Brady's patch is worth less than a penny to start.\nThe star player from the Patriots goes out with a near season ending injury and Tom gets his chance to start.\nSlowly, his patch value goes up as he performs well and builds a network effect of fans.\n\nHe becomes a super bowl winner and his patch value skyrockets... It even becomes very speculative in the \"ceiling\" of its value. His patch value crashes a good amount because of the off-season and people lost interest in football.\n\nAs football season starts, more activity on his jersey patches raise the value of each patch. Very early on the price action is very volatile (but trends up overall due to interest) because we are not sure about if he can sustain his own performance. I.E. injury/computer hacks, swan events, something better (like ethereum) comes out where the QB is more mobile... Think Vince Young, Michael Vick, etc.\n\nYet the same rule applies. Only a limited amount of game jerseys will ever be produced. Those who got the earliest game jerseys have the biggest \"fan  network effect.\"\n\nWhen it gets really speculative, they can simply cut up a piece of a patch even more... Down to its smallest unit and call it a Brady (Satoshi) so that everyone can own a piece of Tom Brady.\n\nAs we know, Tom Brady played for many many years and was very successful (perhaps the greatest QB of all time). There are no more Tom Brady Jersey's being produced.\n\nFootball continues (money printing/Traditional currency). Tom Brady is still going quite strong at peak interests because he is the GOAT of football. \n\nBut eventually, his name will lose steam over time as the \"show\" goes on. He may very well still hold a good amount of value as his name will still hold a prominence (just like stars from older generations and their value). \n\nBut, to say... Every player will be pegged to Tom Brady for its value is not the best system going forward because Tom Brady was not the NFL. \n\nThe NFL enabled Tom Brady to gain prominence. People love Tom Brady so much (The biggest fans who got in early) that they try to build a narrative that the NFL should change its name to the TBFL (Tom Brady Football League) and as a nice little fun coincidence, his last Super Bowl win was with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His legacy is now even more cemented for the naysayers of his greatness.\n\nAfter his retirement from football, jerseys are still being produced, new players and even more fun and vibrant colors and logos are being created to fit the time and to keep the interest in the league.\n\nTom Brady didnt fail, he was awesome and great for his time... Perhaps needed to help gain more trust in the system again, and to have the system become more creative in keeping \"interest\" in the league. \n\nBut to say his name and likeness should replace the league all together would not be wise at all. \n\nHe can no longer play at his level and sustain performance and interest for the League as a whole... He would also suppress the value for new players and their performance because everything is pegged to him.\n\nHe is still remembered, and his scarce Jersey's are highly valuable, but they do not comprise the value of the entire NFL.\n\nMore \"Value\" will always be generated in the League and new ways and players to sustain performance.\n\nNew fans will not care as much about Tom Brady because he was from a different Era. \n\nThere are also no more of his patches that they can easily get at a meaningful level because all of the patches have already been distributed.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pw97eg/my_personal_view_on_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

And how does Ethereum address this? ####**Is Decentralization merely a buzz word and a means to an end?**\n\nUltimately, everyone wants:\n\n1. **Availability and fault tolerance**: The blockchain continues running even when some nodes are unavailable.\n2. **Safety**: Network operators can't seize or use assets without permission.\n3. **Censorship-resistance**: Network operators can't censor valid transactions.\n4. **Transparency/auditing**: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger and verifiable through permissionless nodes.\n\n####**Full decentralization isn't necessary to obtain these security properties.**\n\nThere is no blockchain that exists today with full decentralization. Fortunately, there are ways to acquire security through **protocol design** without needing full decentralization. Features like L2 exit hatches and recovery through a proof system provide anti-censorship properties regardless of whether the L2 network is centralized. \n\nOther designs like Attestor-Proposer-Builder Separation create a separation of powers where the builder can be centralized, but overall block production is decentralized due to proposers and attestors being decentralized. (This is the opposite of proof-of-work where a miner is single-handedly responsible for building, validating, and proposing the block.)\n\nIf decentralization were absolutely important, we wouldn't be using mining pools, staking pools, CEXs, L2 networks, and wallets that rely on RPCs. The Nakamoto Coefficient measures the number of bad entities it takes to compromise a network. If decentralization were absolutely important, we'd be avoiding networks with low Nakamoto Coefficients like Bitcoin and Ethereum. And we'd be avoiding networks with low client diversity, or with high miner/validator hardware requirements.\n\n####**How does Ethereum addresses security?**\n\nDespite having a low Nakamoto Coefficient, Ethereum fundamentally still has all the benefits of decentralization because it is designed with:\n\n* **Very high economic security and safety** from Proof-of-stake. Aligned economic interests where the people holding the token are incentivized to protect it. Cannot be attacked by miners without economic stake.\n* **Very high client diversity** with 10+ independent client dev teams to allow for fault tolerance and high decentralized governance\n* **Deterring malicious actors** by slashing validators who act badly. This increases economic security.\n* **Providing Economic finality** through its Casper-CBC finality gadget, which also prevents long-range attacks and deep reorgs\n* **Providing sustainable security budget** through EIP-1559 and validator rewards to support network security indefinitely\n* **Attestor-Proposer-Builder Separation**: Ethereum builders are centralized. However, that doesn't matter since there is attestor-proposer-builder separation where the builders are separated from the nodes proposing the blocks, which are also different from the nodes validating the blocks. This separation will be further enshrined in the upcoming Glamsterdam update.\n* **Layer 2 rollups at Stage 1-2 inherit the security of L1** despite having centralized sequencers because honest transactions can be forced, and dishonest transactions can be economically-reversed through proof mechanisms even without the support of the centralized sequencer.\n\n####**How does Bitcoin addresses security?**\n\nAnd despite having a low Nakamoto Coefficient, Bitcoin has ... umm ... none of these.... Sorry, never mind.\n\nI'm sure the adoption of Stratum v2 miner-submitted block templates will eventually pick up by the year 2050.\n\nAnd we can only hope they figure out a sustainable security budget protocol.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1puut50/is_decentralization_merely_a_means_to_an_end_and/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The creators of the system discovered their software's faults and maintained the lie that the centralized database could not be directly edited. A mutable ledger with no transparency protected their incompetence and caused massive collateral damage.\n\nThis is the ultimate fallacy with arguments that say privacy is only revered by criminals, ergo bitcoin is only a currency for illegal transactions.

Making it a legit business so I could expense &amp; capitalize stuff. Watching endless youtube videos on the best gpu builds.

It’s end of 2025, and “altseason” has quietly been pushed from 2024 to 2025 to now maybe 2026. What’s changed isn’t timing, it’s belief. Fewer people actually think it’s coming anymore.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality is that altcoins used to rally on new buyers. That buyer base is basically gone. Crypto Twitter, maybe \\~50k people, already owns altcoins. These are cycle veterans, already exposed, already burned, already allocated. There’s no fresh capital here to move markets.\n\nRetail is fragmented and underfunded. The only entities that can actually move prices are funds, institutions, and wealthy allocators. They draw the chart. And they are not buying altcoins.\n\nWhy? Because most altcoins don’t represent ownership.\n\nGovernance tokens especially have been exposed over the past year. On paper, token holders vote. In practice, turnout is tiny, execution is optional, and core teams or foundations retain override powers under “security” or “urgency.” When votes conflict with insider preferences, outcomes get delayed, reframed, or bypassed. Over time, rational holders stop participating. Governance turns into theater.\n\nSky(MakerDao) is a good example. Votes happened. Debates happened. And yet major decisions were effectively decided elsewhere. Participation collapsed once it became clear votes didn’t constrain outcomes.\n\nEven if governance worked perfectly, it still wouldn’t solve the core issue: institutions don’t buy voting rights. They buy ownership.\n\nThis leads to the deeper structural flaw: the DAO vs devco split. Tokens live in DAOs. Teams, IP, trademarks, and execution live in labs companies. When acquisitions happen, buyers acquire the devco, not the DAO. The token isn’t bought. Holders don’t benefit. We’ve seen this repeatedly with Tensor, Padre, Axelar, and others.\n\nThe people and IP move on. The token is left governing an empty shell.\n\nThis problem even applies to Ethereum. ETH is a utility token, not ownership. It doesn’t guarantee cash flows, equity, or control. Its valuation depends on demand and relevance, not rights. And relevance is fragile in a world of L2s, fee compression, and improving tech.\n\nInstitutions aren’t avoiding altcoins because they “don’t get crypto.” They’re avoiding them because there’s nothing to own.\n\nUntil tokens represent real ownership, enforceable rights, or cash flows, altcoin season probably stays a meme. Fixing that likely means regulation, securities, and a very different crypto culture.\n\nAnd that’s the real tradeoff no one wants to talk about.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nSince this post got some attention, I made a YouTube video about it: [https://youtu.be/igwZzJuZWNw](https://youtu.be/igwZzJuZWNw)", "lang": null, "likes": 300, "replies": 251, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pr0d56/altseason_is_canceled_forever/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.", "lang": null, "likes": 248, "replies": 58, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pq29wl/vitalik_buterin_warns_elon_musk_that_xs_hate/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

It’s actually hard not to laugh watching it happen in real time.\n\nThey think they’re fighting the system, but they’re not. They’re providing exit liquidity. While retail cheers every short-lived bounce, the big players are unloading positions, locking in gains, and walking away. The money has already been made—it’s just being transferred now.\n\nKeep stacking bros! lol  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ri5n5uyzwz7g1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e87e5e72e14da4b44905eff0a959ae4875e8af", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ppwcp3/come_on_where_are_the_posts_about_bitcoin_longs/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Every time the market pulls back, the sentiment flips instantly. People start talking like the entire industry has stalled out.. meanwhile, in the background, adoption is accelerating faster than ever. It's almost comical how disconnected price and reality can be in this space.\n\nLook around: governments are openly discussing Bitcoin strategy, Japan is lowering crypto taxes, stablecoins are basically the default remittance rail in half of LATAM, tokenization is becoming an actual banking product, and institutions keep building even if they're not shouting about it. None of that looks like an industry losing momentum.\n\nAnd the mainstream spillover is getting harder to ignore. Sports, entertainment, retail - all of it is slowly tying itself into crypto infrastructure. A good example is how several digital-asset companies have landed major partnerships this year. Nexo showing up as the crypto partner for the Australian Open (and other big sporting events earlier in the year) is the kind of thing you wouldn't have seen during past downturns. You don't get that level of visibility unless the industry is moving into the normal part of life category.\n\nThat's why I find the current doom-and-gloom narratives funny. Prices dip - they always do - but the underlying adoption curve hasn't slowed at all. If anything, the pace of real-world integration is faster now than when the market was euphoric. Historically, this is the phase where people hesitate... then look back two years later and wonder why they ignored all the obvious signals.\n\nAnd honestly, at some point the pattern becomes impossible to ignore. Every dip gets framed as \"the end\" and every time the world just absorbs more crypto into daily life. You can only watch governments weaken their currencies, watch institutions move on-chain, watch real-world businesses adopt this stuff and watch global events partner with crypto companies for so long before the picture becomes obvious.\n\nPeople get scared by the short-term noise, but the long-term trend feels almost baked into the structure now. Maybe the real risk isn't the downturns - maybe it's assuming these moments will always last. Because if crypto really does keep sliding into the role fiat used to play, then hesitating at the lows will look a lot different in hindsight than it does in the moment.\n\nTake the headlines how you want, but the direction of travel seems pretty clear.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 0, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pp2yn4/looks_like_crypto_repeats_the_same_cycle_price/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Gaining consensus is priority number one. That is hard because OGs don't like the term \"freeze.\" The proposal isn't writing rules to freeze particular keys, it is preventing use of signatures that are unsecure. So all holders would be given time to transition to private keys that are secure against post quantum capabilities.  I think Lopp frames the right questions and counterpoints. \n\nI've raised my thoughts on this as well and posted some ideas on how to transition.  I actually agree it doesn't make sense to leave open a method where quantum computing can steal keys.\n\nClosing that gap may come at the expense of some that fail to ever transition, but if they've been given years to transition, there isn't a strong argument that it isn't fair.  Securing the chain needs to happen.\n\nI've followed the quantum resistant coin category for a long time as a holder of Qanplatform.\n\nWhile many of the projects in the space talk about how they hope to capitalize from users seeking assets already prepared, I still view that as a long shot play.  Which is why most have moved toward building utilty chains. \n\nI think there is a large market incoming as all systems will be making upgrades.  Combining cryptography transition methods and blockchain utility will offer solutions enterprises want.  And they don't have the same decentralized challenges to overcome.  They can start implementing now, and we are seeing that happen.\n\nGlad to see the shift where nearly all coins are working on their approach.

Not tax advice. Talk to your own tax professional about your specific situation. Specific to the USA.***\n\nYear-end is approaching and the window to make powerful tax plays for the 2025 tax year is closing fast.\n\nI’m a CPA with a deep background in crypto tax (formerly helped build a client-facing crypto service firm as GM, now leveraging that experience to build robust crypto tax software as Product Lead at Summ (formerly Crypto Tax Calculator)).\n\nI see the same confusion every year, so I wanted to share some high-level, educational context around tax loss harvesting that may be useful as people review their 2025 activity.\n\n# What is Tax Loss Harvesting?\n\nTax loss harvesting is the act of intentionally selling an asset that has gone down in value from your initial purchase in order to \"realize\" the loss for tax purposes.\n\nBy selling/swapping at a loss (as opposed to simply holding), you trigger a tax loss that can be used to directly offset any capital gains, or even ordinary income (up to $3k, the rest is carried forward).\n\nThe key point: losses don’t exist for tax purposes until they’re realized. Simply holding an underwater asset doesn’t create a deductible loss.\n\n***How does it work?***\n\nA simplified example:\n\nIf that losing position is disposed of before year-end, the loss can reduce the net taxable capital gain. If it isn’t, the unrealized loss provides no tax benefit that year.\n\nI see a lot of traders hold onto losers “just in case,” then get surprised by a larger-than-expected tax bill because those losses were never realized.\n\n*PS -- dead memecoins and NFTs are a tax loss harvesting goldmine.*\n\nSimply put, if I have a $50,000 capital gain from selling ETH at profit (or any crypto, stock, or real estate), but am sitting on a $22,000 unrealized loss from a bad memecoin trade, I could dispose of that asset to reduce my taxable capital gains from $50,000 --&gt; $28,000.\n\n*The catch?*\n\nThis disposal needs to happen **BEFORE YEAR END** in order for it to count for your next tax return.\n\n# Why is this current market a particularly good opportunity (and risk)?\n\nIn general, the crypto market has seen a significant increase in value throughout 2025. Bitcoin has climbed 30+% at times, ETH climbing over 150%+ at times etc.\n\nEach crypto-to-crypto swap is taxable. And in rising market, without realizing it, many people have likely triggered taxable gains as they swapped crypto throughout the year.\n\nBut here at year end, markets are generally down from the highs we saw just a few months ago ($125k BTC --&gt; $90k).\n\nThis means that many people are likely sitting on ***unrealized*** losses while simultaneously sitting on capital gains they will need to pay tax on.\n\nI've seen this trope far too many times.\n\n\\--&gt; Flip gains throughout the year\n\n\\--&gt; positions are underwater by year end\n\n\\--&gt; but they still owe the full amount of tax on the gains because they never realized their losses.\n\nFor those who are prepared, this is a *golden opportunity* to pull this lever and directly reduce their tax bill. For those unprepared, they'll be paying far more tax than they need to all because they failed to properly tax plan and consider end-of-year tax strategy.\n\n# Can I rebuy after I sell?\n\nThe short answer is, yes, you can rebuy. This question stems from the fact that with securities, the \"wash sale rule\" requires you wait 30 days before you can rebuy, otherwise, the loss doesn't count. However, with crypto, this is not the case.\n\nThe IRS classifies crypto as property, not a security, see [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). The wash loss sale rule specifically applies only to securities, not property, see [here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/glossary.jsp?term=wash%20sale). Thus, wash loss sale rule is not applicable for crypto (yet).\n\nThis means you could sell your crypto that's underwater, and then decide to rebuy the same crypto without needing to wait the full 30 days.\n\nIn other words, going to my prior example, someone could sell their losing assets and realize the $22,000 loss, and then later rebuy the same amount of those assets back. The end result? They still realize the loss, and still hold the assets in hopes they go back up.\n\n**There is a caveat here**: While the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto, the \"Economic Substance Doctrine\" does.\n\n**What is the Economic Substance Doctrine (\"ESD\")?**\n\nThe ESD is the IRS's magic wand they can waive to disallow a loss they deem to \"not have economic substance\". In other words, if you're in an audit and the IRS determines a loss is a result of a transaction that did not have any economic substance (ie selling and rebuying *immediately* for the SOLE purpose of finessing a tax loss), then they *might* disallow the loss.\n\nThis means it is best practice to make these transactions with additional goals in mind. e.g., maybe you'd like to rebalance your portfolio so you sell down your losing positions to stop the bleeding and then independently decide which assets you'd like to be exposed to moving forward.\n\nThe takeaway here is that while the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto, that doesn't mean the IRS can't disallow the loss if they determine the transaction didn't have economic substance.\n\n# What is the best way to know which of my assets to sell?\n\nTo evaluate harvesting opportunities, you'll need your detailed transaction history and cost basis by lot (not average)\n\nFor the insane people out there, some do this by Excel. Jokes aside, this is a feasible option for anyone who has fairly simple activity such as just a few trades a year on a single exchange.\n\nFor those who want a more automated process or have a more complicated transaction history (multiple exchanges/wallets, more than a dozen trades a year etc), most rely on a crypto tax calculator. Coming from the service-provider space, we only used software as excel just doesn't cut it in most cases.\n\nFor software, there are a few options out there to chose from, but I personally use Summ for mine (obviously!). That said, I always recommend trying a few and seeing which works best for you. Don't just pick one because someone online likes it, try em out yourself!\n\n***Determining opportunities:***\n\nOnce you've loaded your data into your software of choice, make sure you're transaction history looks complete and accurate. If the software offers a tax loss harvesting feature, then you can use that for your investigation. But if your software doesn't offer that feature, one super easy way to do some testing is to simply create manual transactions *simulating* sales to see what the tax impact is. From here, you can dig even deeper by looking at the tax lots being disposed.\n\nFor example, maybe I simulate the sale of 1 BTC and it comes back with an ***overall*** $2k loss. But, I can drill down even further.\n\nWhen I look at the tax lots being disposed, I can see that the 1 BTC sale might be made up of 3 different tax lots. Maybe two of them are resulting in a loss of $1,500 and $4,500 respectively, and the third tax lot is resulting in a gain of $4,000, making the overall sale a $2,000 net loss.\n\nWith this info, now I know I don't need to sell the whole 1 BTC, but instead can just sell the partial amounts that makes up the two tax lots that would result in a total of $6,000 loss, which is even more powerful then selling the full 1 BTC.\n\nBy doing this, I am only selling the BTC tax lots that result in a loss while leaving the tax lot with an unrealized gain in place.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAs a CPA, I am CONSTANTLY asked how to reduce tax. This is truly one of the most powerful levers a taxpayer can pull in order to reduce their bill to Uncle Sam.\n\nIf anyone has any questions or commentary on the topic, feel free to drop them below. Per usual, always consult with your own tax professional for tax advice specific to you. Cheers, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!\n\n\\- JustinCPA, Product Lead @ Summ", "lang": null, "likes": 31, "replies": 22, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1poi6e5/tax_loss_harvesting_serious/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Powell’s basically saying the Fed is “well positioned to wait and see” and that policy should help the labor market stabilize...he even said it might only tick up one or two more tenths rather than roll over hard. Also important: he said they haven’t made any decision about January.\n\nThe interesting part here is futures markets briefly priced in about a 31% chance of a January cut after the jobs data (then it cooled a bit). Looking further out, the market is still leaning toward roughly two cuts during 2026.\n\nFor crypto this is kinda mixed signals. Lower rates usually mean more money flowing into riskier assets like Bitcoin and ETH because traditional savings become less attractive. But if the Fed stays cautious and keeps rates higher for longer, that could keep pressure on crypto prices in the short term.\n\nETH is currently trading around $2.93k and crypto hasn’t really reacted much even after last week’s 0.25% Fed cut.

I think a lot of people are still sleeping on what's happening with crypto in LATAM - especially Buenos Aires.\n\nIf you actually follow the scene there, it has become insanely active in 2025. Buenos Aires hosted Devconnect Argentina in November 2025, billed as an \"Ethereum World's Fair\" with thousands of builders, creators and devs flying in from around the world. That basically turned the city into a global hub for real crypto development and collaboration, not just another conference stop.\n\nBefore that, Merge Buenos Aires ran in March 2025, bringing together Web3 leaders and communities from Europe and the Americas for panels, talks and networking. And earlier before that, the Aleph Crecimiento Pop-Up City event ran through much of March, turning parts of the city into collaborative, builder-centric spaces for several weeks.\n\nAll of this isn't happening by accident. Argentina already has one of the highest real-world crypto adoption rates in the world, thanks in part to people using stablecoins and digital assets as everyday payment and savings tools in an inflation-heavy economy. That gives the city something most \"crypto hubs\" only wish they had: actual usage, not just conference vanity. \n\nNow add in moves like Nexo acquiring Buenbit and making Buenos Aires its LATAM regional hub - and you start to see the real picture. That's a global platform positioning itself directly in the markets where people live and breathe crypto, at a time when infrastructure and talent are both exploding. They’re bringing institutional-grade security, yield products and credit tools that people here actually need - think of it as private crypto banking rooted in real adoption. \n\nWhat makes this interesting is how different it feels from past cycles. This is builders, users, regulators and platforms all pointing toward the same direction at once. The region is already showing its own cycles and liquidity patterns that don't always match the U.S. or EU - and big companies are now betting on that. \n\nSo yeah - while the world debates narratives, LATAM is producing results. If this trajectory holds, the next global crypto capital won't be New York or Singapore. It'll be Buenos Aires - and 2026 might be the year the world finally has to admit it.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 3, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pneecc/is_buenos_aires_quietly_becoming_the_next_global/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Someone posted a chart showing BTC crashing to $3 if that happened and sold off Satoshi's million coins.\n\nWilly Woo jumped in saying that old school Bitcoin holders would actually buy that flash crash. His point is that the Bitcoin network itself would survive because most coins today aren’t “instantly exposed” to a quantum attack in the same way the oldest ones are (especially if you’re not reusing addresses).\n\nHeres the issue tho. The numbers vary depending on how people count it, but it’s definitely “millions of BTC” that are more exposed. Some of it sits in really old formats like P2PK, and a bigger chunk is coins tied to reused addresses / situations where the public key is already known. Satoshi’s stash is part of that whole “very old coins” conversation people keep bringing up.\n\nAdam Back who's been around since Bitcoin's early days says we dont need to worry for like 20-40 years. He thinks theres plenty of time to upgrade everyone to quantum-resistant security before any real threat emerges. Standards for quantum-proof encryption already exist apparently.\n\nThe intresting part is that analyst James Check says the real risk isnt the technology itself but the market panic. He says theres \"no chance\" the Bitcoin community would agree to freeze Satoshi's coins before they get hacked, so if it happens we'd see massive selling pressure.\n\nalso, if panic trading actually hits, the boring stuff becomes painful fast. people will swap a ton, move coins around, maybe jump chains. and then months later you’re trying to untangle what you did. tools like awaken.tax are basically for that exact mess, just keeping cost basis and reports clean when things get chaotic.\n\nPersonally I think if quantum computers advanced that fast we'd have bigger problems than Bitcoin prices lol.

Cypherpunks, crypto bros, red pills, finfluencers, and other fantastic creatures sold a dream to the average dreamer: financial freedom, enhanced privacy, the end of monetary tyranny. Over the past decade, a romantic narrative captured libertarians and anarchists with the force of a gospel: Bitcoin (and other cryptos) would be the final refuge from the State. Unseizable money. Pseudonymity. The perfect tool to escape the tax-hungry frenzy of governments that treat citizens like taxable cattle—and from the parasitic banking system.\n\nWhat Amazon delivered to our doorstep was an omniscient, omnipresent surveillance system that charges transaction fees for the privilege of feeding it.\n\nMost users operate under the illusion of “pseudonymous anonymity.” There’s no name or Social Security number in the block explorer, therefore we’re protected. That’s only true in a world without external context.\n\nBitcoin is an immutable ledger. Every unit carries its entire history. Unlike cash—which has no memory—Bitcoin remembers. Always. This isn’t an accidental flaw; it’s the heart of the system.\n\nWhen funds leave a KYC exchange and arrive in a self-custodied wallet, the link is established. No need to break cryptography. Graph analysis does the rest. Identifiable entry points make the system retrospectively transparent.\n\nThis is structural. Even with perfect opsec, a public blockchain remains an eternal database.\n\nIt’s important to distinguish: possibility is not inevitability. States aren’t omniscient, nor do they have infinite resources. Jurisdictions vary. Priorities change.\n\nBut modern surveillance doesn’t work case by case. It works by accumulating data and applying it selectively later. An irrelevant event today can become incriminating tomorrow. The evidence doesn’t decay. It doesn’t technically expire. It just waits for sufficient interest.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t guarantee persecution. It guarantees retroactive auditability. That’s already a lot.\n\n“Fine,” you say, adjusting your metaphorical hoodie, “then I’ll use Monero. Its blockchain is opaque.”\n\nAnd here things get more interesting—and sadder.\n\nMonero’s cryptography is genuinely robust. Ring signatures, stealth addresses, obfuscated amounts. Direct transaction tracing is genuinely hard. But you, dear anon, may be the weak link. In modern forensic accounting, when we can’t follow the money, we follow the device. Or behavioral patterns. Or both.\n\nUsing a privacy coin on a regular computer is like locking the safe and leaving the key under the doormat.\n\nYour IP address: if you access your bank and your Monero wallet from the same home Wi-Fi without Tor or a decent VPN, your ISP can correlate the data. It depends on cooperation and analysis, but the possibility exists—and possibilities have a habit of materializing when there’s enough state interest.\n\nYour phone’s MAC address: if you installed a KYC exchange app on the same device you use to access anonymous accounts, the device chassis becomes your fingerprint. Dedicated devices mitigate this. Most people don’t use dedicated devices.\n\nCanvas fingerprinting: websites silently ask your browser to draw an invisible image. Micro-variations in your GPU make that drawing unique like a fingerprint. Visit a regulated site and then an anonymous market in the same browser without blockers, and the hash identifies you—VPN or not. This isn’t Monero’s fault. It’s a structural vulnerability of the modern web.\n\nMonero offers superior on-chain privacy. Off-chain, it’s a different battle—and it requires rigorous opsec that most people don’t practice.\n\nIn trying to erase traces, many turn to mixers. Tornado Cash. CoinJoin. The promise of “cleaning” coins.\n\nFrom a forensic standpoint, you’re not necessarily cleaning the money. You’re flagging it as suspicious.\n\nBitcoin’s fungibility is a polished fiction. Compliance tools used by major exchanges—Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace—automatically label funds that passed through mixers as “High Risk” or “Potential Illicit Activity.” Especially after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, using a mixer became almost a confession.\n\nTry sending those “mixed” funds to Binance or Coinbase. The outcome is predictable: immediate freeze. The algorithm detects the mixer, locks your balance, opens a compliance case. You wanted privacy. You got radioactive money—useless in the formal economy.\n\nThere are more sophisticated strategies, specific contexts where mixers work. But for the average user, trying to hide often makes things worse.\n\nWhat about instant swaps? Offshore exchanges that promise no documents?\n\nSome work. For now. But they carry a risk few properly calculate: in the worst case, they’re honeypots. Traps run or infiltrated by the very people you’re trying to avoid.\n\nThese companies live in gray zones. Their survival depends on the tolerance—explicit or tacit—of global authorities. Many adopt quiet compliance to avoid shutdown. The risk trigger works like this: if incoming funds look suspicious, the system freezes the deposit and demands a passport to release it. You enter anonymous. You leave forcibly identified.\n\nEven platforms that don’t ask for a name at entry log IP, timestamp, transaction hash. When Interpol or the tax authority sends a subpoena, many “libertarian” exchanges hand over the logs immediately. It depends on jurisdiction, pressure, and the cost-benefit of resisting.\n\nThe platform promising anonymity today may be compelled—or simply decide—to cooperate tomorrow.\n\nThe forums’ favorite excuse: “I’ll say I was hacked. That I lost the private key in a boating accident.”\n\nThe State doesn’t play only by the rules of cryptography. It uses net worth analysis.\n\nIf you claim to have lost your crypto fortune but the following year buy property in cash, the tax authority applies the net worth method. Where did that money come from? A judge can reverse the burden of proof: prove lawful origin. If you can’t—because the origin is the crypto you swore sank at sea—the situation gets ugly.\n\nThe blockchain validates the transaction. Economic reality validates intent.\n\nFor local, physical exchanges, cash is still unbeatable.\n\nFor private digital transactions, coins like Monero work—provided they’re paired with rigorous opsec, dedicated devices, and acceptance of friction.\n\nFor the average user seeking “effortless financial freedom,” Bitcoin offers something different from what was promised: permanent global traceability.\n\nNo one said it would be easy. They said it would be revolutionary. Maybe it’s both.

The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nAlso, the second you *do* recover something like this, there’s a whole “ok now what” layer people forget. Cost basis, old exchange records, DeFi trails, what’s taxable vs what’s just a transfer. That part isn’t fun, but it’s real. Stuff like Awaken tax exists basically for that exact cleanup when your history is chaotic and you don’t want to guess and overpay.  \n  \nIts kinda funny but also dark when you think about how much wealth is permanently locked away because people forgot passwords or lost hardware. This movie will probably give everyone watching anxiety about their own crypto storage.\n\nWill definately watch this just to see how they handle the technical aspects and whether they make it accurate or go full Hollywood nonsense.", "lang": null, "likes": 18, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pkzwn8/netflix_is_making_a_comedy_movie_about_a_couple/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Move along if not interested.\n\nI was involved in crypto from 2020-2022ish. Did the research, drank the metaphorical cool-aid. Cryptocurrency resonated with me due to a love of finance, technology and decentralization independence. Not to mention the slew of problems materializing and present in traditional fiat finance.\n\nI made some money, and thought I would be a forever holder. But then got caught up in the Celsius and BlockFi bankruptcies. Eventually leading to the sale of all of my cryptocurrency due to the belief that the layman would never be savvy enough to store their own keys, and centralized layer 2 was just reinventing the traditional finance system, but with less consumer protections.\n\nFast forward to today, a hobby miner caught my interest and reignited my passion for crypto.\n\nSo here I am, trying to convince myself to get back into cryptocurrency. However, upon further research, the foundation of crypto seems to have changed.\n\nPrimarily my concerns are the following:\n\n1.\t⁠The upcoming security budget problem as the Bitcoin halving continues to make mining less profitable.\n\n2.\t⁠MSTR and the flywheel leverage default risk.\n\n3.\t⁠Tether minting unverified stablecoins that prop up the crypto market. (this one existed when I was in crypto prior also)\n\nHow are all of you navigating these risks? Like I said, I WANT to be involved, because i recognize the value of a decentralized network. But the above very real potential downsides make me nervous with FUD.\n\nThanks for reading the whole post!

I logged every explicit prediction they made — price targets, time horizons, cycle calls, macro takes — and tracked whether those predictions actually came true.\n\nI began this as a personal project to bring accountability, but also to test whether structured prediction data from YouTube creators contains any measurable **predictive power** when aggregated or analyzed over time.\n\nAt first I did everything manually, but as the workload grew I built a simple internal tool to help organize transcripts, extract predictions, and manage labeling. *(Screenshot in post.)*\n\n\n\n# What I measured\n\nFor each prediction, I currently log:\n\n• the exact claim  \n• the timeframe  \n• the outcome\n\n**One thing I’m adding next is a “prediction difficulty” score (baseline probability).** I haven’t finished labeling this yet, but it matters — some predictions are trivial (“BTC will be higher in 12 months”), while others are extremely low-probability. Raw accuracy alone can be misleading without this adjustment.\n\nThis should help distinguish creators who show real skill from those who primarily make safe predictions that tend to happen anyway.\n\n\n\n# Early results (raw accuracy only — baseline coming next):\n\n# 1. Many creators hover around coin-flip accuracy\n\nSurprisingly consistent across channels.\n\n# 2. A smaller group consistently beats the crowd\n\nMacro-focused, data-driven creators stand out even before difficulty adjustments.\n\n# 3. Accuracy varies heavily by topic\n\nSome creators are strong on macro or BTC cycles but weaker at short-term timing or altcoins. Expertise appears domain-specific.\n\n# 4. The least accurate creators often sound the most confident, are the most charismatic, and rarely track their misses\n\nWins are emphasized, losses disappear, and confidence often replaces accuracy — a strong example of entertainment value overshadowing forecasting skill.\n\n# 5. There are early signs of predictive signal when separating reliable vs. unreliable analysts\n\nEven with the raw dataset, patterns emerge:\n\n* **Consistently reliable analysts → positive signals**\n* **Consistently unreliable analysts → potential negative indicators (contrarian signals)**\n\nIgnoring the noisy middle and focusing on the extremes may offer statistically useful directional hints.\n\n\n\n# Why I’m doing this\n\nCrypto YouTube is:\n\n* noisy\n* emotional\n* unstructured\n* and full of incentives that bias messaging\n\nBy turning predictions into structured data, I can explore deeper questions:\n\n* Does aggregated analyst sentiment contain tradeable predictive signals?\n* Which creators show persistent forecasting ability, and which ones are noise?\n* Are some creators better in specific market regimes (bull vs. bear)?\n* Can shifts in collective prediction patterns act as early indicators?\n\nIt’s still early, and adding the baseline-probability layer will make the results far more meaningful.\n\nIf anyone has creators they think should be added — or if you see holes in my methodology — I’d love to hear your thoughts.

ETH managed to break above the $3,200 and $3,250 resistance levels that were holding it back. The price even pushed past $3,350 and touched a high of $3,396 before consolidating. Right now its trading above $3,200 and showing strong momentum with a bullish trendline forming around the $3,210 support level.\n\nThe technical setup looks pretty solid. If ETH can break above the $3,380 resistance it could target $3,420 next and possibly even $3,500 to $3,550 in the near term. The momentum indicators are flipping bullish with the MACD gaining strength and RSI above 50 which usually signals more upside potential.\n\nWhats intresting is Ethereum is outperforming btc right now. While BTC struggles around $92k, ETH is showing relative strength which could mean we're seeing a rotation into alts or specifically into Ethereum based on fundamentals or technical breakouts.\n\nHowever theres still risk here. If ETH fails to clear the $3,380 level it could pull back to support at $3,250 or even $3,210. A break below $3,210 would be concerning and might send it back toward $3,150 or lower.\n\nThe consolidation after the initial pump is actually healthy. It shows buyers are absorbing supply at these levels rather than just a quick pump and dump. The question is whether buyers have enough strength to push through the next resistance zone.\n\nETH dominance has also been ticking up on the charts lately, which kind of supports the idea of a short term momentum shift away from Bitcoin, at least for now.", "lang": null, "likes": 71, "replies": 126, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pis67s/ethereum_just_smashed_through_resistance_and/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}
