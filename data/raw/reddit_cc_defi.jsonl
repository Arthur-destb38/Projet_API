My previous post, “[Altcoin Season Is Canceled](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pr0d56/altseason_is_canceled_forever)” got 240K views. Clearly, many people are wondering what is happening with altcoins and what their future looks like.\n\nMost commentators debated whether we actually had an altcoin season at all. One user, u/MaximumStudent1839, identified my pain point and argued that the whole \"ownership\", \"equity\", and \"cash flow\" was misleading and \"brain hemorrhage\". His view was simple: tokens should be treated as store-of-value assets driven purely by consensus. No future cash flows, no fee growth, no usage-based valuation. Just owning tokens based on their role and necessity within a given blockchain. Bullish on network-effect assets and bearish on some DeFi tokens, \"ICM\" tokens, etc.\n\nIn that framing, crypto is not a security, registered or unregistered. It is a collectible, sometimes with utility tied to an adjacent protocol.\n\nWhile I was responding to comments, Stani, the founder of Aave landing protocol, was effectively demonstrating how this theory plays out in practice.\n\nI made a video braking down how AAVE DAO debacle unfolded [https://youtu.be/NLDFTqavmNA](https://youtu.be/NLDFTqavmNA) and how Gary Gensler might have been right.\n\nThe moment the SEC dropped its investigation early Dec '25, Aave Labs switched the swap provider on its frontend and redirected fees away from the DAO. The amount is not huge - $10m, roughly one ninth of total Aave fees. Still, the principle matters. AAVE token holders do not benefit if fees accrue anywhere outside the DAO treasury.\n\nThis raised a key question. Should the DAO control all Aave IP and all fees generated by its storefront? Some may think this is not very important, but what if storefront fees eventually exceed protocol fees? AAVE holders should care where value is created and where it flows.\n\nThe vote happened, and Stani voted against the initiative, carrying about 33% of the voting power. Days before the vote, he spent roughly $12M buying AAVE. Good for price, bad for decentralization. Other large holders abstained. And realistically, why would they vote against the founder? He is responsible for their gains and has the most skin in the game.\n\nNow consider the real risk. What if tomorrow there is a decision to funnel protocol fees to another wallet and cut off the DAO entirely? Would the minority be able to unite and vote against it?\n\nDAOs are a compelling idea, but in practice the founding team has the final say. If they decide to sell the labs, as we saw with Axelar, Padre, and Tensor, token holders have no real way to intervene.\n\nSo you can throw most of the decentralization and governance narrative out the window. It does not work in the real world. Like communism, it sounds good on paper. When trying to make everyone equal - someone will always be more equal than others.\n\nTo be precise, it does work, just not the way it is advertised. DAOs simplify corporate governance, make it transparent, and put voting onchain. But they only cover the technical layer of governance, not ownership or control.\n\nAt the end of the day, crypto tokens function like unregistered securities. The best outcome we can realistically hope for is that the current SEC administration under Paul Atkins carves out a niche with more relaxed rules for digital securities.\n\nThat would simplify development and further integrate TradFi. At the same time, it would likely compress valuations, as criminal and scam capital would be forced out toward privacy chains that even most DEXs do not support.\n\nForget about altcoin season. Forget about “the next cycle.” Pumps will still happen, but only for a select few, mostly new tokens with the right timing, the right narrative, heavy marketing budgets, and VC or cabal bundling. Do not hold, and definitely do not DCA into any project tokens.\n\n2024–25 taught me that, in the long run, capital preservation matters more than capital growth. In 2026, I’m bullish on L1/L2 ecosystems and platform tokens with strong network effects, and bearish on most project coins.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year.", "lang": null, "likes": 89, "replies": 53, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pwhabi/aave_just_killed_decentralization_2026_outlook/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

This sub isn’t very fond of memecoins, but there are a few of us here.  \nWe are now in the 3rd memecoin winter, and after the Oct 10 lows, we’re picking up steam again, with more tokens deployed, more graduating, and higher volume. Tokenized communities end up being stickers then jpegs.   \n(attaching some ss at the end)\n\nEveryone talks about 10000x and pnl ss, but very few talk about survival. After trading memecoins for over two years, one thing has become painfully clear to me: capital preservation is the real edge, not finding the next 67.\n\nPersonally, I started with roughly 40 sol but stuck to 5% risk per trade (2 sol per trade). While making a tutorial on memecoin trading, I debated what the absolute minimum is to survive in the trenches.\n\nBesides ruggers, drainers, and extractors, memecoin trading has a lot of taxes that compound. It’s not just buy and hope. Every trade is taxed by reality. You pay trading fees, terminal fees, priority fees, bribes, failed transactions, slippage, and opportunity cost. All of that adds up very quickly. When learning and starting with only 10 sol (\\~$1.3k), traders often forget to adjust their axiom buy/sell filters, and fees eat their sol.\n\nOver time, it becomes obvious that undercapitalization is the number one reason people fail. Trading with tiny size forces you into bad decisions. You chase harder, hold longer, and gamble more because the math no longer works. That’s why I believe 10 sol is the minimum threshold to trade memecoins seriously. If you don’t have 10 sol that you’re fully prepared to lose, you probably shouldn’t be trading memecoins at all.\n\nWith 10 sol, trading 0.2 sol per trade makes sense. That’s roughly 2% risk per trade. You can get rugged 50 times straight. You can learn how narratives move, how liquidity behaves, and how social signals evolve without blowing up your stack in a single afternoon. Survival gives you time, and time is the only thing that compounds in this market.\n\nSome KOLs advise against such small numbers and say to get a job instead. No comments. Others say they grew small stacks into meaningful ones. Maybe they did. But the real question is whether that’s repeatable without pure luck. Is it realistic to grow from very small size once fees and bribes are factored in?\n\nI’m curious where others land on this. We aren’t getting many $10m mooners these days. Is 10 sol truly enough to learn the ropes? Is 0.2 sol the right position size once all costs are considered? And more importantly, should capital preservation be the primary goal in memecoin trading, or is that mindset incompatible with the market itself?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nState of memecoins in Dec 2025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/957mwhgvvn7g1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa2794448bddf2790c3755ccf8e680108f2b8f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcgppggvvn7g1.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dbf44966caa39f8d15399bd5f416e10583e83cd", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1poivbd/meme_coin_traders_is_02_sol_per_trade_enough/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nAlso, the second you *do* recover something like this, there’s a whole “ok now what” layer people forget.

Kwon pleaded guilty in August and took responsibility. He wrote to the court saying he was responsible for the pain people went through and that he led the community astray in his hubris.\n\nSBF on the other hand went to trial and maintained his innocence throughout. He claimed FTX just had a liquidity crisis not actual fraud. The judge also called him evasive, found perjury, and cited witness tampering.\n\nAnother factor is what happens next. Kwon can potentially face more time back in South Korea, and prosecutors there have talked about seeking a very long sentence too.\n\nThe takeaway here is pretty clear. cooperation + remorse matters a lot, and going to trial + lying under oath will get you hammered.\n\nalso kinda wild side note: both of these cases are basically “paper trail” cases. not saying taxes are the same thing as fraud, but it’s why i’m big on keeping clean records now. if you’re a normal person just staking/trading, at least don’t let the boring stuff ruin you later. i’ve been testing Koinly and Awaken.tax just to keep wallets/defi/exchange history readable in one place.", "lang": null, "likes": 230, "replies": 69, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pkheq9/do_kwon_just_got_sentenced_to_15_years_for_a_40/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

This site will replace and significantly expand upon the current ccmoons.com functionality.  \nCurrent features include viewing token KPIs (holders, earners, price, supply), subreddit statistics, karma estimators, Moon history, integrated Uniswap trading, and more functionality coming soon.\n\n# 2. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/) &amp; [https://rcryptocurrency.com/](https://rcryptocurrency.com/)  \nNew Community Hub (soft launch): [https://rcryptocurrency.com](https://rcryptocurrency.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance (Snapshot): [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nAdvertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 3. Treasury Overview (as of December 8, 2025)\n\nAsset balances and valuations:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,190|$42,885|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,619|\n|USDC|2,080|$2,080|\n|USDT|1,366|$1,366|\n|USDC.E|$487|$487|\n|ARB|1,848|$393|\n\nTotal non-Moon value: $6,945  \nChange since last update: -$ 5,223\n\nStablecoin value (USDC + USDT + USDC.E): $3,933  \nPrevious stablecoin total: $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins: -$4,681\n\nThe largest expense was $6,100 USDC for MIDAO legal registration, sent directly to MIDAO.\n\nThe DAO added \\~$1400 in stablecoins, excluding the MIDAO payment.\n\n# 4. Burn Summary\n\nNew burn totals:\n\nArbitrum Nova: 3,197,609  \nArbitrum One: 1,038,816  \nTotal burned: 4,236,425 Moons\n\nPrevious totals (November 9):  \nNova: 3,189,800  \nOne: 1,038,094  \nTotal: 4,227,894\n\nChanges since last update:  \n• Nova burn increase: 7,809 (driven mostly by Kraken’s AMA event)  \n• Arbitrum One burn increase: 722  \n• Combined burn increase: 8,531 Moons\n\nBurns on Arbitrum One remain low as incoming revenue is being used to compensate for Kraken’s pure burn, per the transparency report.\n\n# 5. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DoL)\n\nThe DAO currently maintains one liquidity pool position.\n\nCurrent composition:  \n• 93,100.95 Moons  \n• 284.62 USDC\n\nValue breakdown:  \n• Moon value: $4,839  \n• USDC value: $284.62  \n• Total DoL value: $5,124.52\n\nThis is lower than last month due to Moon price moving from approximately $0.0634 to $0.0519.\n\nThe low USDC proportion reflects the fact that as sponsor revenue enters the DAO, market conditions have pushed Moon’s price downward, causing the pool to accumulate more Moons and less USDC. This is functioning effectively as automatic buy pressure, allowing sellers to exit into deep liquidity while the DAO accumulates Moons cheaply.\n\nAs additional revenue arrives, we will continue rebalancing the pool and shifting toward a 50–50 asset split. If Moon’s price rises, the balance will naturally adjust.\n\n# 6. Distribution Update\n\nPolygon Labs is sponsoring $5,000 in POL tokens for creator rewards. Subreddit users will receive 32,000 POL tokens.\n\nFor Moon Week 69, the DAO will distribute 7,440 Moons.  \nDuring Moon Epoch 69, the distribution wallet received 7,441 Moons.\n\nThe Community Currency App has continued to experience occasional technical issues. If the claim interface is down, users may use manual withdraw commands. We encourage anyone with issues to ask for help.\n\nLong-term, the plan is to migrate claims to [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com), where users will be able to claim rewards directly from our website without relying on the external app.\n\nSince the last update, three projects held AMAs:  \n• Kraken  \n• Stellar  \n• Space Computer\n\nThis is a normal slowdown for year-end in crypto, as many teams pause marketing during holiday periods and uncertain market conditions.\n\n# 7. Governance Update\n\nThere were no governance proposals this round.\n\nHowever, one user has applied for the vacant Ecosystem Growth Officer position. This nomination will go live as a formal governance vote once the MIDAO legal proposal cycle completes.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe primary focus remains on completing the transition to the new [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com) platform. This website will serve as the central community hub outside Reddit, offering dashboards, analytics, creator reward claiming, advertiser onboarding, and a wide range of community tools.\n\nDeFi integrations will continue to expand, including additional liquidity management and possible new partner protocols.\n\nI am actively working on a bridge contract with support from u/jwinterm. Our goal is to integrate bridging directly into [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com), allowing users to move Moons seamlessly between Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nWe also hope to host a Moon livestream (MOON Stream) later this month to review everything the DAO accomplished in 2025, share the status of MIDAO recognition, and outline 2026 goals.", "lang": null, "likes": 21, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1phptu0/ccmoon_dao_update_december_8_2025_moon_week_69/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Most newer and modern blockchains use a mix of soft and hard forks for updates. Older blockchains often soft fork to maintain backwards compatibility with old and insecure client versions.\n\nBy definition, a hard fork is an update or event that will result in a chain split if block producers and node clients continue using different versions.\n\n####**Soft Forks result in code bloat, dangerous practices, and technical debt**:\n\nSoft forks maintain backwards compatibility with older clients, so they need to add additional code logic to detect and deal with all the different types of clients they might encounter. This creates developer complexity and code bloat by continuously supporting archaic and dangerous practices.\n\n**Imagine what would happen without hard-forks**:\n\n* Newer WiFi routers would still support the insecure WEP or WPA protocol\n* Browser would still support old, insecure versions of SSL\n* Newer computers would still support Windows 3.0 (launched 1990) natively\n* Windows 11 would still support early 1990s Intel 386-generation hardware.\n* All city roads would still allow for horses and wagons.\n* All US stores would still accept 3-cent, 5-cent and 10-cent paper notes; and half-cent, 2-cent, and 3-cent, and large cents; and $100,000 bills.\n* Doctors would still support dangerous practices such as bloodletting, mercury prescriptions, arsenic prescriptions, and trepanning (drilling holes into skulls)\n\nIt's dangerous to never hard fork.\n\n####**Bitcoin soft forks results in complexity and update delays**\n\nBitcoin still supports many outdated legacy addresses such as P2PK, P2MS, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKSH, P2WSH. Each of these has their own special quirks, and every Bitcoin client needs to add additional complexity to support them. Many of these aren't quantum secure and should be prevented from transferring in the future, which requires a hard fork.\n\nBitcoin nodes also take forever to update to a new version. It wasn't until mid-2024 that most clients supported transferring to Bech32m addresses that were introduced in May 2021. Taproot, which requires Bech32m support, also took nearly half a decade to obtain significant client support. That's because unlike with hard forks, Bitcoin nodes aren't required to support the latest features. So it takes the Bitcoin network half a decade to pick up new features.\n\n####**Bitcoin has hard-forked at least twice, and that's perfectly fine**\n\nLastly, contrary to popular opinion, Bitcoin's canonical chain has actually hard forked at least twice unintentionally.\n\n1. There was a temporary 0.8 update related to the 2013 reorg (where a 51% attack and double-spend also occurred). Had the update been planned as a hard fork instead of soft fork, there wouldn't have been a disastrous chain split.\n2. The 0.3.6 OP_NOP update also resulted in a hard fork a year later when the first OP_NOPX transaction was submitted in block 163685.\n\nPre-0.3.6 Bitcoin clients no longer sync with newer versions due to a hard fork, and that's not a bad thing. No one should be running archaic versions of Bitcoin client.\n\nJameson Lopp discovered that 7 out of 21 known Bitcoin consensus updates were of the hard fork type and not the soft fork type. They could've been triggered by a \"poisoned\" transaction like in the November 2025 Cardano chain split, but no one ever submitted one for 5 of them. These include Bitcoin 0.2's best chain selection logic, Bitcoin OP_VER update prior to 0.3.6, the scriptSig bug patched in v0.3.7, the critical inflation bug patched in v0.15.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1paox12/opinion_hard_forks_are_necessary_for_eliminating/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The account value is 50 Million in total, they can not get liquidated for a really long time, (43k)\n\n  \nSo if you see a post on X or here on reddit without an address, look twice or best, don't look at all, it's crazy how completely made up most of my feed is now.", "lang": null, "likes": 46, "replies": 22, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1paio2r/xcom_is_full_of_fake_posts_about_insider_trading/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Back then it was normal to see 15–20% APY and not ask too many questions. Now whenever I see double digits, my first thought is: *“what exactly is going to blow up to pay for this?”*  \n  \nFor me it kind of breaks down into three buckets: DeFi, sketchy CeFi, and the more regulated CeFi stuff.  \n  \nDeFi first. Yields are back on things like Curve, Pendle, Aave, etc., and if you know what you’re doing, there are still some really nice plays there. But nothing about the underlying risks has changed: smart contract exposure, exploits, governance drama, incentives that vanish the moment emissions run out. I’m happy to put part of my stack in DeFi, but I’m not pretending it’s “safe yield.” It’s still, “this might be fine, or this might be a lessons-learned post in three months.”  \n  \nThen you’ve got the classic offshore “trust me bro” platforms. The ones offering flashy APYs with zero transparency, vague T&amp;Cs, and some office somewhere you’d never actually visit. I used to dabble in those. Now? Hard pass. Too many stories where withdrawals get “temporarily paused” until everyone’s wiped out.  \n  \nThe last bucket is the more boring, regulated CeFi side. Think Nеxo, Gemini, and a couple of others. Actual licensing, audits, collateral frameworks - and at least a clear idea of where the yield comes from. The rates aren’t wild anymore, but the whole appeal is that it’s supposed to be boring.  \n  \nNеxo is the one I’ve ended up using for the stable part of my stack. After trying pretty much everything, a few things stood out. They’ve been operating for years without a single hack, which is rare in this industry. They’re properly licensed and supervised in multiple jurisdictions, not just “registered somewhere.” And their support is true 24/7 - when something feels off, you get a human, not a bot that replies three days later.  \n  \nRates for stables sit in that mid to high single-digit range depending on loyalty tier and setup. Nothing crazy, but consistent, transparent, and without lock-ins or gimmicks. For me that’s the point - if I wanted stress, I’d be farming on some new L2 with 14 audits and still pray nothing gets drained.  \n  \nOne thing I didn’t expect to use as much is their card. Being able to keep most of my liquidity in stablecoins, spend directly from that balance, and earn cashback without dealing with off-ramps or bank delays makes everyday spending a lot smoother. It’s closer to how crypto should feel: fluid and instant.  \n  \nNone of this is “go all in on X.” There’s no such thing as fully safe yield - just a spectrum from “this might get exploited tomorrow” to “this has a track record, regulation, and structure behind it.” But in 2025, I’d rather have fewer surprises and slightly lower APY than roll the dice for a few extra percent.  \n  \nCurious how everyone else is handling it now that stablecoins are moving again. Where are you parking your stables these days if the goal is consistency rather than degeneracy?", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 30, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p86ctm/stablecoin_volumes_are_heating_up_again_and_im/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Aptos is leading the pack with an insane 0.08s, followed closely by Somnia (0.1s) and Sui (0.24s).\n\nL2s vs. High-Performance L1s: It's interesting to see Arbitrum (0.25s) sitting right up there with the parallelized L1s like Sui and Solana.\n\nSolana: Sitting at 0.4s, which is standard for them, but technically slower than the top 5 in this specific metric.\n\nThe 2-Second Standard: Chains like Base, Optimism, and Polygon are consistent at 2s. While reliable, the gap between 0.08s and 2s is becoming noticeable in high-frequency trading or gaming use cases.\n\nDoes block time matter to you as a user, or do you only care about finality and fees?

For lots of members of r/cryptocurrency your vault was likely your first steps into DEFI. For those with MOONs who never wrote down their seed phrase or never got your vault off Reddit.

If yes continue to steps below, If no you don't have Moons in your vault you can ignore this.\n\n**Not sure if you have Moons in your vault heres what you need to do:**\n\nStep 1: Access your vault - by clicking on your profile picture and then scrolling down to vault on Iphone and the old android app\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icd3o11w8f3g1.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f51e5c3908d90df094d2ab7e8d5aab05aa8d1f3\n\nOn the newest android app click on resources -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46knplbf9f3g1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a018735e1c35a97a0df5b7a9e3bb73c0ceb79e07\n\nIf you do not see the vault icon it means you do not have any \"NFTs\" on Reddit, as such you most likely don't have any Moons. Reddit was giving away free NFTs while they were doing Moon distributions so if you don't see the vault you most likely do not have any Moons.\n\n\\---\n\nStep 2: Once you click on the vault, click the setting Icon\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oynysihy9f3g1.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=117ec60e4da68b82ccef0a2bee524fd29bfd6dec\n\nAfter you click the setting Icon you can see your public address.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9umc160af3g1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acddc361c62d1aceb604da2a500debec7876fdfc\n\nNext copy your public address (the 0x characters) into the following url:\n\n[https://nova.arbiscan.io/](https://nova.arbiscan.io/)\n\nIf you have Moons you'll see something like this under token holdings:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpmbje0qaf3g1.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21a46d39c9882107d6a55f54cec94515ff487564\n\nIf you do not have any Moons you won't have anything under Token Holdings.\n\nAssuming you have Moons you now need to go back to this settings page of the vault and reveal and write down your recovery phrase. This 12 word \"seed phrase\" is how you can access your \"Reddit Vault\" on a different device outside of Reddit.\n\nYou can get Arbitrum Nova and Moons on Metamask by following the below steps:\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/CryptoCurrency\\/comments\\/112ax9k\\/comment\\/j8j1b65](https://preview.redd.it/rcq3brenbf3g1.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a9e7ec0751e5fe4631f82dfc54a3cc4ed68268)\n\nYou don't have to get access to your Moons right away but you do need to write down and secure your seed phrase somewhere if you haven't already done it.

Ethereum basically hit the gym, cutting weight and becoming faster and smoother, all of this without sacrificing security. This is a quality of life buff for users, devs and business.\n\nAs you can see in the tweet and in the image above these are the things that Fusaka brings to the table:\n\n* **30–60% cheaper transfers** \\- sending ETH or tokens is more affordable.\n* **3–5x faster-feeling transactions** \\- not instant but close to a no wait just send vibe.\n* **NFT minting costs drop 60–70%** \\-huge for creators, platforms and anyone making drops.\n* **More stability for businesses** \\- Less spikes, smother execution and almost no downtime.\n* **Developers save 25–35% on gas** \\- This will help devs to build more and have less things to cry about xD\n\nThe final result? A better user experience for everyone, from degen traders to Web3 startups or just for people who only touch Ethereum when they mint an NFT.\n\nThis is also cool because Fusaka boosts the whole modular ecosystem without trying to replace rollups or rewrite Ethereum's roadmap.\n\nDecember 3, dont forget that date, it will probably dont affect price in the short term but it will in the long term.\n\nAre you hyped for Fusaka?\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407)", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p660rr/ethereums_fusaka_upgrade_hits_dec_3_massive_ux/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The main reason is the yield structure. Stablecoin vaults consistently return around 5–7% in-kind, and on top of that, Katana distributes KAT rewards. Even though KAT isn’t tradable yet, if it launches with around a $1 billion FDV, my current yield would be about 40% APR. Even if it opens lower, the combination of base yield and rewards still makes it the strongest setup I’ve found across DeFi.\n\nWhat stands out most to me is how Katana approaches vault curation and risk management. The team doesn’t surface every vault available. They focus on a curated set that meets their transparency and risk standards. Vaults surfaced in the Katana app and curated through Vaultbridge were completely untouched by the xUSD and Balancer events that affected other platforms. That outcome reflects how Katana designs its system rather than reacting after the fact.\n\nVaultbridge works with partners like Steakhouse, Gauntlet, and Yearn to create transparent, onchain, risk-adjusted strategies built on blue-chip collateral with conservative LTVs. Katana then channels yield from these vaults back into the network through foundation-managed liquidity and reward programs. The result is consistent, visible, and repeatable yield onchain.\n\nKatana’s structure attracts institutional partners who care about both performance and capital protection. The design of the protocol puts fund safety, transparency, and sustainable yield at the core of the chain itself.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of platforms, and Katana is the one that’s managed to align strong yield, conservative risk management, and transparent onchain strategy. That’s why I’m comfortable keeping my funds there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2txepqzvyh0g1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dc93e51a29455b384724299b4646ab409e051c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18ba6taxyh0g1.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d37e101ebf1217446fb0d4d48d7aeef79c47f78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo0hgvvxyh0g1.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ade14250a9509324971cca9a40ea07da2a364c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbaye7iyyh0g1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c788bc40680a80a131f16af15430ab416f17ab9\n\nLink to tweet that inspired this post: [https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20](https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otprn3/why_ive_stuck_with_katana_through_all_the_recent/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

You create a Twitter handle. A Discord tag. A Reddit name. A login for every exchange, wallet, and dApp. None of them talk to each other, and none of them belong to you.\n\nThis fragmentation goes beyond inconvenience. It reflects a deeper problem: in the traditional web, your identity is something you rent, not something you own.\n\nWeb3 domains change that.\n\n# The Problem With Usernames\n\nUsernames are siloed by design. They’re tied to the platform where they were created, and they can be taken away, suspended, or reassigned at any time.\n\nYou can’t transfer your identity. You can’t verify it across apps. You can’t take it with you. And if someone else grabs the name you want, it’s gone — possibly forever.\n\nMore importantly, a username is not a credential. It exists only as long as the platform allows it.\n\n# What Makes Web3 Domains Different\n\nWeb3 domains are stored in your wallet and secured by the blockchain. No one can reassign them, edit them, or suspend them. Once minted, they’re yours.\n\nThat ownership unlocks functionality usernames simply can’t match. You can use the same domain to:\n\n* Log in to dApps\n* Receive crypto payments\n* Build a unified profile\n* Send and receive onchain messages\n* Access gated communities or experiences\n\nYou don’t need to re-register. You don’t need to manage multiple identities. You don’t need to trust a platform to respect your name. The system is built to work for you.\n\n# Built for Portability\n\nWeb3 domains are designed to move with you.\n\nInstead of creating a new username every time you join a new app, your domain follows you. You can connect it to social platforms, DeFi protocols, wallets, games, marketplaces, and more.\n\nAs adoption grows, your name becomes your default identity across the Web3 ecosystem. One name. One login. One profile. Persistent and portable.\n\n# One Identity, Not a Dozen Accounts\n\nTraditional usernames force you to build a reputation in isolated bubbles. You might have one users on Reddit and another on X. None of those profiles are connected. None of them tell a complete story.\n\nWith a Web3 domain, you maintain a consistent identity across apps. You don’t have to rebuild from scratch every time you try something new. Your domain becomes your access point, your public name, and your reputation anchor — all in one.\n\nThat continuity is valuable whether you’re a creator, a collector, a builder, or someone just getting started.\n\n# What About DNS Domains?\n\nNot all domains are equal. Some DNS domains can be placed onchain, allowing them to participate in the Web3 ecosystem. But DNS domains are still subject to renewals, registrar rules, and external control.\n\nWeb3 domains are fully minted onchain and owned outright. No renewals. No middlemen. No reliance on centralized infrastructure.\n\nIf the goal is ownership, this distinction matters.\n\n# Owning Your Name Means Owning Your Identity\n\nA username identifies you only within the boundaries of the platform that issued it.\n\nA Web3 domain gives you ownership of your name across platforms, protocols, and use cases. You can log in, transact, build, and communicate without needing to rebuild your identity every time.\n\nThe internet is shifting from accounts to identity. And identity starts with a name you actually control.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otk28c/why_web3_domains_are_better_usernames/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve seen a handful of crypto companies succeed.\n\nTo succeed, many hard things must align. To fail, only one key thing needs to go wrong.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in this space, one pattern repeats itself: **the fastest path to failure is biasing toward idealism over pragmatism.**\n\nI joined the industry for its ideals. It took years - and a few hard lessons - to unlearn them.\n\n# Not About Memes or Casinos\n\nThis post is about projects trying to *create* value, not extract it. Those building new rails, not just running the same casino onchain.\n\nMemes and casinos have their own kind of Product-Market-Fit. They entertain, they speculate, they move money. But they don’t *build*. They redistribute value rather than generate it.\n\n**In short, this post is about teams growing the pie, not just grabbing the bigger slice.**\n\n*Now that the disclaimer’s out of the way, let’s get into it.*\n\n# Changing My Mind\n\nI first dipped my toes into crypto in 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on Gitter. For the past four years, I’ve been all in, building full-time.\n\nThat transition, from observer to participant, is when you start facing real tradeoffs. It’s when you stop quoting whitepapers and start debugging production systems. And it’s when your ideals begin to meet reality.\n\nBelow are examples I often bring up when discussing how **pragmatism (not purity) led to success.** These are companies I’ve been learning from.\n\n# Pragmatic Successes\n\n[**PolyMarket**](https://www.polymarket.com/) proved that stablecoins beat custom tokens for early traction in prediction markets. Back in 2016, [Augur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution) kicked off the decentralized prediction markets ecosystem. Most people today haven’t heard of Augur, and know Gnosis mainly as a multisig or credit card company. But, everyone’s heard of PolyMarket, especially after their [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). Their key move was focusing on product over tokenomics, avoiding getting [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by shiny ideals.\n\n[**Solana**](https://www.solana.com/) showed that choosing speed over decentralization can capture real users. Solana’s vision was to run at the speed of the Nasdaq onchain. One of crypto’s deepest ideals is that anyone should be able to run a node or validator at home, in their basement, on a laptop, as part of the network’s collective strength. In practice, running a Solana validator requires professional-grade hardware and DevOps skills. It’s like needing to be an F1 driver just to commute to work. Solana made the hard tradeoff of centralization for performance, and it paid off. With a \\~$91B market cap, pragmatism clearly won.\n\n**Stablecoins** became crypto’s paradoxical success by embracing regulation and existing rails. Bitcoin dreamed of divorcing from the existing financial system; stablecoins married it. Now they’re on track for [$46T in annual volume](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/), with [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) IPOing and the [GENIUS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) adding clarity. They’re as anti-crypto-ideal as it gets, and yet, not showing any signs of slowing down.\n\n[**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/) thrived by offering custody and compliance instead of maximalist purity. Crypto said: *Not your keys, not your coins.* Coinbase said: *Most people don’t want to manage keys.* They made the pragmatic choice to build for real users, not ideals, and onboarded millions because of it.\n\n[**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) is arguably one of the most successful wallets in crypto. Its mission is to bring people onchain, and I’ve heard dozens of founders say it’s the best thing that’s happened to the industry in years. Yet it doesn’t have a token, it isn’t *“crypto-native,”* and it relies heavily on AWS to store user keys \\[1\\]. Its CEO and co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer at FileCoin, a project that embodied true crypto ideals. That experience likely gave him a clear sense of when decentralization helps and when it only slows you down. Privy succeeded by focusing on the user experience over crypto ideals.\n\n**In crypto, pragmatism isn’t about compromise, it’s about sequencing. You can decentralize later. You can tokenize later. But you have to survive in the beginning.**\n\n# It’s Never That Simple\n\nFailure can hinge on one thing. Success demands a harmonic symphony: UI, UX, timing, execution, luck. All must play in tune.\n\nMost people in the OG crypto space start with ideals. That’s good as it draws in smart, mission-driven people. But idealism alone doesn’t build resilient systems.\n\n**Pragmatism doesn’t guarantee success. Idealism often guarantees failure.**\n\nThe only true exceptions? Bitcoin and Ethereum. \\[2\\]\n\n# A Thought to End On\n\n**Decentralization is a byproduct of a permissionless and incentivized system.** It’s an end to a means, not a means to an end.\n\nA fully privacy-preserving, decentralized, permissionless world sounds perfect in theory. In practice, it stalls progress, innovation, and usability.\n\nIn crypto, as in life, **survival belongs to the pragmatists.**\n\n# tl;dr How to Bias Toward Pragmatism over Idealism\n\n1. **Don’t tokenize too early.** Start with stablecoins or fiat rails.\n2. **Don’t decentralize too early.** Use centralized infra, design for later decentralization.\n3. **Find Product-Market Fit first.** Once you have PMF, you can afford ideals and earn the right to strive towards them.\n\n\\---\n\n\\[1\\] Ironically, the world’s most private messenger (Signal) [runs mostly on AWS](https://www.theverge.com/news/807147/signal-aws-outage-meredith-whittaker). It works because users value reliability over purity.\n\n\\[2\\] I’d argue that Zcash is a third exception, but one that’s not known as well (yet).

This update highlights significant financial growth, key integrations, new sponsorships, and upcoming governance proposals that will shape the next phase of the DAO’s development.\n\nThe DAO continues to progress toward formal legal registration through MIDAO, expanding partnerships, and strengthening DeFi use cases for Moons. In the weeks since the last update, we have seen strong revenue inflows, expanded liquidity positions, and new integrations that continue to bring real utility and value to the ecosystem.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of November 9, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $12,168 in non-Moon assets and 823,192 Moons.\n\nMoons decreased by 25,000, representing a transfer to the Community Currency App Bot to refill rewards for outstanding distributions. ETH remains unchanged in quantity but decreased in fiat value due to price movement. The DAO’s stablecoin holdings increased significantly as more sponsorship payments were received.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,192|$52,157|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,998|\n|USDC|6,826|$6,826|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$556|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: $12,168  \nChange since last update: +$3,417  \nStablecoin value (USDC, USDT, USDC.E): $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins since last update: +$3,489\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nArbitrum One: 1,038,094 Moons burned  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,189,800 Moons burned  \nTotal burned: 4,227,894 Moons\n\nSince the October 30 update:  \n• Arbitrum Nova increased by 57,546 Moons (largely from Kraken’s burn event)  \n• Arbitrum One increased by 117 Moons  \n• Combined total increase: 57,663 Moons burned\n\nThese burns highlight continued advertiser demand and the positive impact of large-scale partner events on Moon supply reduction.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nThe DAO now operates two Uniswap liquidity positions to improve balance and fee efficiency.\n\nFirst position (original pool, 0.05% fee tier):  \n• Composition: 67,654 Moons and 960 USDC  \n• Value: $5,455  \n• Total fees earned since last update: $134.37  \n• Breakdown: 1,081 Moons and 62.53 USDC collected  \n• These fees will be redeployed into liquidity after collection\n\nSecond position (new pool, 0.3% fee tier):  \n• Composition: 2,379 Moons and 126.02 USDC  \n• Value: $284.08  \n• Fees earned: $0.74\n\nCombined DAO-owned liquidity value: $5,739.08  \nChange since last update: +$1,948\n\nThese two positions give the DAO flexibility to capture more trading volume during price swings and maintain deeper market presence without needing to sell Moons for rebalancing.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nPolygon Labs has contributed $5,000 in POL tokens to the DAO, equivalent to 25,000 POL for distribution to subreddit users.\n\nFor Moon Week 68, the DAO will distribute 6,820 Moons, reflecting cumulative revenue-based allocation since Epochs 67 and 68.\n\nThe Community Currency App is now fully back online. Redundancies have been added to ensure users can always claim their rewards in the event of future outages.\n\nSince the last update on October 29, the DAO received $8,284 in new revenue from Kraken, Monad, [Rails.xyz](http://Rails.xyz), Quickswap, and ETH Strategy. Kraken’s payment was a pure burn, so the DAO will make up the equivalent amount by allocating future revenues to the Distribution, Treasury, and DAO-Owned Liquidity pools before resuming additional burns.\n\n# 6. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo major proposals will go live this Moon Week:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities that add utility and visibility to Moons.\n\nThese votes mark key next steps for formal structure and operational autonomy within the DAO.\n\n# 7. Teller Integration and Moon Utility\n\nMoons are officially live on Teller, and users can now use their Moons as collateral to borrow USDC or deposit them to earn yield. Teller held an AMA on the subreddit to guide users through the process.\n\nThis integration provides another major use case for Moons in DeFi. Teller’s initial incentive pool is paying a high APY for Moon deposits, funded directly by their treasury, though rewards will decrease over time as total deposits grow.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO’s top priority remains completing legal registration with MIDAO as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize structure, provide legal protection, and enable direct contracting with partners.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n• Continuing DeFi integrations like Teller and Uniswap liquidity expansion  \n• Pursuing grants to support DEX integrations on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n• Building faster bridge solutions between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One  \n• Hosting recurring AMAs and live DAO updates across platforms to expand beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for November 9, 2025. The next update will provide results from the Moon Week 68 governance votes, updated revenue totals, and any additional partnership or liquidity developments.", "lang": null, "likes": 32, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1osv3w1/ccmoon_dao_update_november_9_2025_1_day_prior_to/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

A real transaction, secured by ***Falcon-1024 signatures***, now lives immutably on the Algorand ledger, a transaction that even the world’s most advanced future quantum computer couldn’t break.\n\nFor context, this isn’t just a technical milestone. It’s a statement of intent, one that reshapes what blockchain security means in an era where quantum computing is no longer science fiction but an approaching inevitability.\n\n*“This isn’t theory anymore,”* I added. *“Algorand has crossed the bridge. The rest of the industry is still building.”*\n\n# Why Quantum Resistance Matters\n\nTo understand why this moment matters, you need to understand the risk. Nearly every blockchain today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even most of the newer ones, relies on *RSA* or *elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)* to verify ownership and authenticate transactions. These systems work beautifully against classical computers.\n\nBut against a quantum computer? They crumble.\n\nSince *Peter Shor’s algorithm* in ***1994*** proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum machine could factor large numbers or compute discrete logarithms instantly, cryptographers have known what’s coming. It’s not a matter of *if*, but *when*.\n\nThe danger isn’t just futuristic. There’s what security experts call the *“harvest now, decrypt later”* problem. Bad actors can collect encrypted blockchain data today, store it, and wait until quantum machines mature, then decrypt everything at once.\n\nWhen that day comes, every wallet, signature, and identity built on today’s encryption could be compromised.\n\nThis is why Algorand’s step isn’t about bragging rights. It’s about survival and foresight.\n\n# Falcon: The Cryptographic Shield of the Future\n\nAt the heart of this breakthrough is ***Falcon,*** a lattice-based signature algorithm co-developed by cryptographic heavyweights like *Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert*, and *Vinod Vaikuntanathan,* with contributions from Algorand’s own *Dr. Zhenfei Zhang*.\n\nFalcon, which stands for *Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU*, was selected by *NIST in 2022* as a global standard for post-quantum digital signatures.\n\nIt’s efficient, compact, and incredibly hard to break even for quantum computers.\n\nFalcon comes in two main versions:\n\n* ***Falcon-512***, offering AES-128-level security.\n* ***Falcon-1024***, providing AES-192-level strength — what NIST calls *“Level 5,”* the highest security tier available.\n\nAlgorand uses Falcon-1024. It’s the same signature scheme that already protects Algorand’s *state proofs,*compact cryptographic snapshots that allow other blockchains to verify Algorand’s state without intermediaries.\n\nThe genius here lies in Falcon’s balance:\n\n* Its signatures are larger (around 1,280 bytes) but extremely fast to verify (under 100 microseconds).\n* Signing takes more computation, but verification, the part blockchains do millions of times per day, is lightning-quick.\n\nThat trade-off is perfect for Algorand, where every block involves thousands of signature checks per second.\n\n# Engineering the Impossible\n\nImplementing Falcon in production wasn’t as simple as swapping one signature scheme for another.\n\nFalcon uses *floating-point arithmetic* and *Fast Fourier transforms,* techniques that demand incredible numerical precision. One rounding error, and security could fail.\n\nThe Algorand Foundation’s team tackled this with a deterministic, constant-time implementation, ensuring no randomness or timing leaks that attackers could exploit.\n\nTheir guiding principles were clear:\n\n1. ***No disruption to consensus:*** verification had to remain deterministic.\n2. ***Seamless integration:*** of quantum-secure accounts is needed to act like normal ones.\n3. ***Developer accessibility:*** the system should be easy to use and experiment with.\n\nTo achieve that, Algorand built something elegant: embedding Falcon keys inside *Logic Signatures* smart contracts that control how an account’s funds can be spent.\n\nThese contracts verify Falcon signatures over transaction IDs. If the math checks out, the spend is authorized.\n\nFrom the network’s perspective, it looks no different from a traditional account only it’s *quantum-secure*.\n\n# Building the Tools for a Quantum Future\n\nTo make this accessible, Algorand released the ***Falcon Signatures CLI,*** a command-line toolkit that lets developers actually create, fund, and transact from post-quantum accounts on mainnet or testnet.\n\nDevelopers can:\n\n* Generate Falcon keypairs\n* Derive Algorand addresses from them\n* Fund those addresses\n* Sign and submit Falcon-verified transactions\n\nIn other words, anyone can now mint, sign, and send quantum-resistant transactions.\n\nThat’s not just innovation, it’s democratization of security.\n\n# What’s Protected — and What Isn’t (Yet)\n\nAlgorand’s post-quantum rollout secures individual accounts and the blockchain’s historical state. State proofs — those compact summaries used by other chains — are now fully quantum-resistant.\n\nBut the *consensus layer* still relies on *Ed25519* signatures and **V***erifiable Random Functions (VRFs)* for validator selection. These are classical cryptographic mechanisms that quantum computers could theoretically exploit.\n\nSo while quantum attackers couldn’t steal funds from Falcon-secured accounts, they might still disrupt block proposals or manipulate future consensus events.\n\nThat’s why Algorand’s approach is *incremental but deliberate*: start with user-level protection, gain experience, then move up the stack toward quantum-secure consensus.\n\nIt’s the practical path to secure what’s possible now and evolve systematically.\n\n# Falcon’s Broader Impact\n\nFalcon’s adoption by Algorand has implications far beyond a single blockchain.\n\nBecause it’s *NIST-standardized*, Falcon can act as a *universal language* for cross-chain communication in a *post-quantum world.*\n\nAlgorand’s *state proofs*, already powered by Falcon, could allow other chains to verify data trustlessly with the same cryptographic standard, no intermediaries needed.\n\nThat sets the stage for a *quantum-resistant multichain future* where interoperability and security coexist instead of colliding.\n\nThe open-source Falcon CLI also invites global collaboration developers, cryptographers, even universities can study and improve the system freely.\n\n# The Human Side: Algorand’s 2025 Roadmap\n\nWhile the Falcon achievement represents Algorand’s technical peak, its *2025 roadmap* reveals something just as profound: a shift toward simplicity, usability, and community control.\n\nIn an industry drowning in jargon and fractured ecosystems, Algorand’s message is refreshingly human. The roadmap centers around three core goals:\n\n1. ***Return power to the community***\n2. ***Make blockchain development frictionless***\n3. ***Deliver a user experience that feels like Web2 — but runs on Web3 principles***\n\n# Community Takes the Wheel\n\nAlgorand is handing the steering wheel to its users.\n\nThrough *Project King Safety*, the network plans to redesign its fee and incentive model to ensure long-term sustainability, ending the era of foundation-subsidized economics. A position paper is due in *Q4 2025*, outlining how fees, validator rewards, and network incentives will evolve.\n\nEven more transformative is the *revival of its grant program* under a *new governance structure.*\n\nA community-elected *xGov Council* will now decide which projects get funding — removing centralized gatekeeping and restoring grassroots governance.\n\nThe foundation has already *reduced its stake from 63% to 21%* through a new rewards model, and a *peer-to-peer gossip network* is replacing its centralized relay architecture.\n\nEach of these steps pushes Algorand closer to becoming a *fully peer-to-peer, self-governed ecosystem,*something most blockchains only claim to be.\n\n# Simplifying the Developer Experience\n\nThe next frontier is making blockchain development as easy as writing a mobile app.\n\nIn *early 2026*, Algorand will launch *AlgoKit 4.0,* a major upgrade that introduces composable smart contract libraries, key-value storage *(“Schema”)*, and native support for mainstream languages like ***Rust****,* ***Swift***, and ***Kotlin***.\n\nDevelopers will even be able to use ***AI assistants***, powered by large language models, to help write and debug contracts, merging artificial intelligence and blockchain into a single development flow.\n\n*“Algorand is building a bridge for developers who don’t want to learn ten new programming languages just to build on Web3.”*\n\nFor enterprises, *Intermezzo*, debuting in *Q3 2025*, will handle all the hard stuff: key management, blockchain integration, and compliance. Businesses will be able to launch blockchain-backed loyalty programs, digital assets, or identity systems with almost no technical friction.\n\nAnd for users? That’s where *Rocca Wallet* comes in.\n\n# Rocca Wallet: Web3 Without the Headache\n\nIf Falcon is the brain of Algorand’s evolution, *Rocca Walle***t** is its face.\n\nSet for *preview in Q4 2025* and an *open-source release in 2026*, Rocca aims to eliminate one of the biggest pain points in the crypto complex: intimidating wallets.\n\nIt supports *passkey logins* (no seed phrases), *fee abstraction* (users don’t even see *“gas*”), and *decentralized identity* (no centralized logins or data leaks).\n\nIt’s also *white-label*, meaning DApps can brand and customize it so the blockchain experience can fade into the background, letting usability take center stage.\n\nIn short, Rocca makes Web3 feel like Web2 only safer, faster, and fully decentralized.\n\n# Powering the Real World\n\nAlgorand’s 2025 vision also extends beyond the screen. It’s targeting real industries where blockchain can quietly improve everyday life:\n\n1. ***Tokenized Financial Products*****:** Using the *ACTUS framework*, Algorand is building smart contract models for tokenized debt and equity, with a *Debt ASA MVP* expected by *Q4 2025*.\n2. ***Agentic Commerce*****:** Supporting AI agents that can transact autonomously via ***X402*** and *A2A payments,* blurring the line between AI and DeFi.\n3. ***Self-Sovereign Identity*****:** The Rocca Wallet will enable verifiable credentials — like *WorldChess’s Universal Chess Passport*, which lets players compete globally without centralized logins.\n4. ***Data Integrity*****:** Strengthening blockchain’s role as a permanent, verifiable record for supply chains, enterprises, and beyond.\n\n# Privacy, Scalability, and the Quantum Edge\n\nAlgorand isn’t just catching up — it’s leaping ahead.\n\nIts upgraded ***AlgoPlonk*** zero-knowledge system will make privacy faster and more flexible, while exploration into *multiparty computation (MPC)* and *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* lays the groundwork for transactions that remain private even while being processed.\n\nMeanwhile, *parallel execution* and *block pipelining* are set to supercharge scalability, allowing multiple transactions to run at once and cutting block confirmation times even further.\n\nAnd in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the *first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*\n\n# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats\n\nIf the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.\n\nBut what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a *guardian layer,* a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?\n\nThat’s precisely where ***Algorand*** could step in.\n\nThrough its ***Falcon-based state proofs*** and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a ***quantum-safe validation hub*****,** a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing *BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins* to operate within a *quantum-secure environment* without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.\n\nImagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand’s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand’s *quantum-proof framework,* preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.\n\n*“If Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,”* I noted, *“it could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.”*\n\nThis kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to *stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails* as well. Since Algorand’s state proofs already support *trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.\n\nIt’s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand’s technology isn’t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be *future-proofing everyone else*, too.\n\n# Staying True to Web3’s Promise\n\nWhile other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:\n\n* *Transparency*\n* *Security*\n* *Community-led governance*\n* *Sustainability*\n\nIts uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn’t even exist yet.\n\n# A Glimpse at the Horizon\n\nAlgorand’s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.\n\nFalcon’s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  \nThe 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren’t opposites; they’re the same path forward.\n\nTogether, they redefine what *“Web3 readiness”* really means.\n\nIt’s not about speculation.

The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.\n\nBefore Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.\n\nBeyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.\n\nBeyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nEvery operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.\n\nAcross Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.\n\nThe effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.\n\nIn parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.\n\nTogether, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.\n\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.

Ask us anything about the BONK Launchpad and the BONK DAT, BNKK Hello r/CryptoCurrency,\n\nWe are contributors from the BONK ( r/BONKfunOfficial ) ecosystem and team members involved with BONKfun and the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (Bonk Inc., ticker BNKK). We are here to discuss BONK’s ecosystem growth, the launchpad model, and how the treasury operates.\n\n# About BONK\n\nBONK is a community-driven token on Solana focused on building products that generate real activity and direct value toward the token. The BONK ecosystem includes BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, an NFT marketplace, and consumer-facing applications that bring new users to Solana. BONK currently has more than 400 integrations, operates on 13 chains, and is approaching one million onchain holders.\n\n# About BONKfun\n\nBONK . fun is a launchpad for meme tokens built around transparent economics. It allows anyone to create a token in minutes, with fees distributed to support the BONK ecosystem. Half of all platform fees are used to buy and burn BONK, 8 percent are used for BONK accumulation, and the remainder fund operations and development. Public dashboards track activity, fees, and burns in real time. The platform has become the largest launchpad on Solana, accounting for more than half of all new token launches in mid-2025.\n\n# About the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (BNKK)\n\nBonk Inc. (Nasdaq: BNKK) is the public-markets digital asset treasury dedicated to BONK accumulation. It receives a 10 percent revenue share from BONKfun and reinvests about 90 percent of that income into open-market BONK purchases. The company currently holds about 2.75 percent of BONK’s circulating supply and has stated a target of 5 percent by the end of 2025. The treasury is actively managed through partnerships with institutional asset managers to generate non-dilutive yield and preserve capital.\n\nThis structure connects ecosystem activity with public-company participation. Revenue from BONKfun creates recurring buy pressure, while the treasury establishes a corporate vehicle aligned with BONK’s long-term growth.\n\n# Topics we can discuss during the AMA\n\n* How BONKfun works and what differentiates it from other launchpads\n* The structure of BONK’s burn and buyback system\n* The design and purpose of the BONK Digital Asset Treasury\n* How revenue from BONKfun and other applications flows into BONK accumulation\n* The broader BONK ecosystem and integrations on Solana and other chains\n* The significance of approaching one million holders and the planned one-percent supply burn\n* The role of Bonk Inc. in bridging onchain activity with traditional finance\n\nWe will be answering questions from this thread during the AMA window.\n\nThank you for having us, and we look forward to your questions.\n\n— The BONK Team", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 79, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oq0oqq/ama_we_are_the_bonk_team_ask_us_anything_about/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Public companies and onchain organizations are increasingly holding tokens as long-term assets. To date, most treasuries have focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin. These assets offer stability and liquidity, but their size limits how much impact new accumulation can have.\n\nBONK occupies a different position. With a market capitalization of about $1 billion dollars, it sits in the mid-cap range, supported by an expanding ecosystem and a growing treasury. We believe this combination of scale and structure gives BONK a higher potential for compounding growth than the larger, slower-moving assets dominating current treasuries.\n\nThe BONK Digital Asset Treasury is operated through Bonk Inc. (BNKK). The company currently holds about 2.75% of the circulating supply and aims to reach 5% by the end of 2025. It earns a 10% revenue share from BONKfun and allocates roughly 90 percent of that income to open-market BONK purchases. This model transforms ecosystem activity into continuous, recurring accumulation.\n\nEach percentage of supply added to the treasury represents tens of millions of dollars in new demand. Because BONK’s market cap is smaller than traditional treasury assets, this level of accumulation has a more visible effect on overall market depth and pricing.\n\nBONK’s ecosystem is one of the most comprehensive among meme coins. It spans more than 400 integrations and operates on 13 chains. Core components include BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, and an NFT marketplace, along with partnerships in sports, fitness, and entertainment. These products anchor BONK’s position within Solana while expanding its utility beyond trading.\n\nThe community is also approaching one million onchain holders. When that threshold is reached, a 1% supply burn will take place. Combined with ongoing burns from ecosystem products, this structure reinforces BONK’s deflationary design and long-term alignment with active users.\n\nWhat separates BONK from other digital asset treasuries is its leverage to growth. Large-cap assets require massive inflows to move the market, while BONK’s scale allows smaller amounts of new demand to create measurable change. It maintains liquidity across Solana and additional chains, offering accessibility while retaining room for appreciation.\n\nMost existing treasuries simply hold their assets. BONK’s approach creates a feedback loop in which product success funds further accumulation. It connects platform revenue, community activity, and corporate structure under one framework that compounds over time.\n\nBONK combines the community energy of a meme token with the operational discipline of a public treasury. It is verifiable, active, and built on a foundation of measurable economic inputs rather than speculation.\n\nIn the broader context of digital asset treasuries, BONK illustrates how smaller-cap assets can use real revenue and structured accumulation to drive value. It represents a faster, more reflexive model with the potential for greater upside as the ecosystem and treasury continue to expand.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1opcve8/bonks_digital_asset_treasury/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The past few weeks have been full of major progress across governance, treasury, partnerships, and real-world DAO formation efforts. What began as a decentralized subreddit project is now moving closer than ever to becoming a legally recognized organization with active DeFi integrations and expanding sources of revenue.\n\nThe most exciting development is that the DAO is now on the verge of becoming an officially recognized legal entity through MIDAO, based in the Marshall Islands. After a meeting with MIDAO representatives, we were offered a discounted rate of $6,100 through 2026 (normally $12,500) to register as a non-profit DAO LLC. This will give CCMOON DAO legal standing, limited liability protections, and greater legitimacy in future partnerships. A proposal is live now on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta, and the vote is scheduled for Moon Week 68.\n\nAnother major milestone is the Teller integration on Arbitrum One. Moons are now live on Teller, a decentralized lending protocol, offering 22% APY paid directly in Moons. Teller is funding this program from its own treasury by making market purchases of Moons to pay rewards. Within the first 48 hours, more than 1.5 million Moons—over $100,000 worth—were deposited. This is a massive leap forward for Moon utility and onchain participation.\n\nWe have also filled another key DAO Officer role, adding a Technology &amp; Infrastructure Officer. The current officer roster and open positions are listed below. The Community Engagement Officer and Ecosystem Growth Officer positions remain open, and the usual 50,000 Moon holding requirement has been removed so more members can participate. If you’d like to nominate yourself, you can do so on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta.\n\nOver the last 2.5 weeks, the DAO received about $5,000 in new revenue from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, BONKfun, and Polygon. This continues our growing stream of recurring payments that support burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity.\n\nLet’s take a look at where everything stands as of October 30.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\n* CCMOON DAO Constitution v 0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution) \n* Website: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/) \n* rCryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0) \n* Governance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth) \n* Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck) \n* Transparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of October 30, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $71,370 in total value.  \nThe last update on October 13 reported a treasury value of $76,865. While total value has decreased by roughly $5,495, the non-Moon portion of the treasury has increased by about $610, and the stablecoin portion (USDC, USDT, USDC.E) has increased by approximately $1,224. This reflects real growth in liquid assets despite the price decline in Moons.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|848,192|$62,618|\n|ETH|0.83683|$3,105|\n|USDC|3,337|$3,337|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$521|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: approximately $8,750  \nChange since last update: +$610 non-Moon value (+$1,224 in stablecoins)\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nTotal and change since October 13 update -\n\nArbitrum One: 1,037,977 Moons burned (+16,616)  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,132,254 Moons burned (+10)  \nTotal burned: 4,170,231 Moons (+16,626)\n\nThese burns continue to demonstrate healthy advertising and partner activity across the DAO’s integrated platforms.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nDAO-Owned Liquidity is held in the USDC–MOON pool on Uniswap.\n\nUniswap Pool: [https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650](https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650)  \nWallet for tracking: 0x33D549e99bae2Ff38cA1AdB280f77151C86E1b3c\n\nCurrent position value: $3,791  \nComposition: 29,210 Moons and 1,615 USDC\n\nFees earned since the last update: $21.13  \nMoon size since Oct 13: +6880 MOON   \nUSDC size since Oct 13: +733 USDC  \nTotal DOL growth since last report: +$964 in total value\n\nThe DAO moved from a v4 to v3 Uniswap pool to ensure integration compatibility with Teller. This pool is now the reference pricing source for many DeFi applications on Arbitrum and will continue to earn fees and reinvest them.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nDistributions continue to follow the new 12-month revenue-based model approved in the previous update. Assuming no additional burns, approximately 4,000 Moons will be distributed each period.\n\nThe app used to claim Moons and poll rewards is currently offline due to AWS and Microsoft outages. The technical team is working with service providers to restore functionality and evaluating redundancies to prevent similar downtime in the future.\n\nWe are also exploring additional sponsorship-based distributions similar to the previous Polygon campaign that contributed $5,000 in POL tokens for subreddit users.\n\n# 6. Sponsorships and Partnerships\n\nRevenue received since October 13 totals approximately $5,000, with payments from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), and Polygon. These funds were allocated across burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity per the standard 25/25/25/25 split.\n\nUpcoming and active AMAs include Teller (live now), SurfAI, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), Pineapple, Trezor, and multiple Monad announcement posts and AMAs.\n\nTransparency and payment tracking are visible at:  \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\n# 7. Moons on Arbitrum One\n\nMax total supply: 9,668,157 MOON\n\nHolder distribution:  \nCamelot v3 pool – 1.8M (18.75%)  \nTeller supply – \\~1.5M (15.23%)  \nBurn address – 1.04M (10.74%)  \nDAO multisig treasury – 848K (8.77%)\n\nOver one-third of the total supply is now actively productive in DeFi pools, burned, or held in the treasury.  \nExcluding the burned supply, that rises to around 40%.  \nIf the DAO multisig is also excluded, nearly 45% of all circulating Moons on Arbitrum on are now engaged in active DeFi use cases.\n\n# 8. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo proposals are currently live on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities to support Moon utility and development. \n\nBoth proposals are scheduled for a Moon Week 68 vote.\n\n# 9. Bridge Development\n\nThe DAO is exploring new bridging solutions to improve movement of Moons between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One. Current bridging options are limited and slow—most notably, the canonical Arbitrum bridge requires a six-and-a-half-day transfer period. We are reaching out to third-party bridge teams to create a faster and more user-friendly path between networks.\n\nUsers are encouraged to move Moons to Arbitrum One if they wish to participate in integrations like Teller and future DeFi partnerships, as Arbitrum One currently has broader ecosystem support.\n\n# 10. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO’s number one goal remains to complete legal registration as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize our status, protect contributors, and allow direct contracting with partners and advertisers.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n• Expanding DeFi utility for Moons via Teller and Uniswap integrations  \n• Pursuing grants to fund a DEX integration on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n• Building a faster cross-chain bridge for Nova to One liquidity  \n• Hosting recurring AMAs and live update streams to reach broader audiences beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for October 30, 2025.

Our goal is to allow users to supply single tokens and earn more of the *same* token with no dual-asset pairs, no impermanent loss, and no lockups.\n\nFor example, you supply $MOON, you earn more $MOON automatically -- Simple. No gimmicks.\n\n**How does Teller work?**\n\n* We initially launched our [rewards program on Base](https://blog.teller.org/earn-compounding-yield-on-base-tokens-with-teller/) and have now expanded it to other networks: you can supply and stake your favorite tokens on Teller to earn up to **22% APY** per block.\n* No lock-ups. You can withdraw anytime.\n* No impermanent loss, because the protocol doesn’t use AMM style liquidity pools for lending. Instead: peer-to-pool lending. Borrowers draw from a pool; lenders deposit; borrowers repay interest.\n* As borrowing demand rises, the APY can go higher (ranging from 20-60%) because yield comes from borrower interest payments + our incentive program.\n* Once liquidity in a pool hits $100K, expect the incentive portion to gradually decline, with the organic borrowing interest taking over more of the yield burden.\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\n* For token holders: you can hold a token you believe in, deposit it, and earn more of that same token, rather than converting into something else and dealing with pairs or LP tokens.\n* For risk control: because you're supplying single assets and there's no AMM, you avoid impermanent loss (which happens when you provide LP tokens and the relative price of the assets changes).\n* Transparent incentives: We’ve laid out how the yield is constructed (incentive side + borrower interest side) so users can understand what they’re participating in.\n\n**What are the risks?**\n\n* Lending always has default risk — borrowers might not repay. The protocol isolates pools by token to reduce cross-token risk. If a borrower does default then the collateral is put up on an onchain dutch auction, sold, and then returned to the pool.\n* Liquidity risk: While the protocol allows withdrawal anytime, if a large part of the liquidity is borrowed, there could be constraints (or interest rates might go up).\n* Token risk: Because you’re holding a token, you’re exposed to price volatility of that asset (even though there's no impermanent loss).\n* There is always contract risk, as with any protocol. However, Teller is 3 years old, has been audited 3 times, and uses Hypernative to protect against reentrancy attacks.\n\n**Holding $MOON?**\n\nThere is currently over 1% of the $MOON supply staked on Teller!\n\nYou can now supply and stake your MOONs to start earning more MOONs.\n\nSee the image below for an example of how much you can earn:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/np0gxios1byf1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7e011c5d2c53fa1cfe75092234286e251eeec0\n\n\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/ama-teller-launches-rewards-program-earn-22-compounding-v0-j7ktwmji0byf1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7003ebfd53a6d4a4ecbc485c1c2d0543c5525db6)\n\n**How you can start earning:**\n\nStep 1: Go to [app.teller.org](https://t.co/Qi6U79QY9X)\n\nStep 2: Connect your wallet \n\nStep 3: Select your network\n\nStep 4: Select a lending pool \n\nStep 5: Supply + Stake your tokens and start earning 22% yield\n\n\n\n**Ask us anything!**", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 71, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oka1vr/ama_teller_launches_rewards_program_earn_22/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

That includes ETH, stETH, LP tokens, Aave positions, or WBTC — not just stablecoins like USDC. The assets stay on Ethereum Layer 1, continuing to earn yield, while traders open and manage positions on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nThe key innovation here is that this cross-layer collateralization is **fully verifiable through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs**, not bridges, oracles, or multisig custodians. Earlier systems couldn’t do this because ZK tech wasn’t mature enough to efficiently prove complex financial state changes (like order matching, margin calls, and liquidations) at scale. Lighter built custom ZK circuits and a specialized “Order Book Tree” that make it computationally feasible to verify every operation — including those involving collateral that never leaves Ethereum.\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Collateral stays on Ethereum (L1)** You lock ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or other supported assets into Lighter’s L1 smart contracts. They remain on Ethereum, keeping their native yield (e.g. stETH still earns staking rewards).\n2. **Collateral is registered in the L2 state** Lighter’s rollup records the locked asset in its state tree so it can be used for trading margin. The L2 handles execution through a low-latency sequencer and proves every transaction with ZK circuits.\n3. **Trading happens on L2** Orders are matched on a central-limit order book. You can trade any listed pair using the collateral value of your L1 assets. None of your assets move unless you’re liquidated.\n4. **Liquidations and settlements are cryptographically enforced** If a position becomes under-collateralized, the L2 generates a ZK proof of the liquidation event. That proof is submitted to Lighter’s Ethereum contract, which verifies it and automatically releases only the required portion of the locked collateral. No human intervention, no trust assumptions.\n5. **Full composability with DeFi** Because assets remain on Ethereum, they can still interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem — earning yield or being tokenized for use elsewhere. The same logic applies in reverse: DeFi positions can serve as margin on Lighter.\n\n# Why It’s Different\n\nPrevious perpetual DEXs and L1 derivatives platforms faced trade-offs:\n\n* **Bridges and oracles** introduced trust and delay (often hacked or manipulated).\n* **Monolithic alt-L1s** like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid had to rebuild their own ecosystems, isolating liquidity.\n* **Optimistic rollups** could not liquidate in real time due to challenge periods.\n* **ZK rollups** before now couldn’t efficiently prove multi-asset financial logic.\n\nLighter’s architecture removes these limits. Cross-margining multiple DeFi assets becomes **provably safe** — verifiable on Ethereum with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n# Why It Matters\n\n* **Capital efficiency:** traders can use yield-earning assets without selling or wrapping them.\n* **Security:** all collateral and state roots are settled on Ethereum; nothing depends on a bridge.\n* **Verifiability:** every trade, liquidation, and collateral adjustment is backed by a ZK proof.\n* **Integration:** native composability with Ethereum means Lighter can plug into existing DeFi protocols instead of competing with them.\n\nIf it works as described, UCM could shift on-chain trading from isolated collateral systems to a **capital-agnostic model**, where any Ethereum asset can serve as trustless margin — something earlier generations of DeFi simply couldn’t do.\n\n# Sources\n\nLighter whitepaper (October 2025) — discusses the core architecture, Order Book Tree, ZK-proof system and collateral logic. - [https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf](https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nInterview on the Bankless podcast with founder Vladimir Novakovski — confirms the roadmap including Universal Cross Margin and the ZKVM sidecar. - [https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex](https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ojuslv/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

For the first time in several years, the story, the data, and the execution all align. POL’s market capitalization grew 39.2% quarter over quarter to $2.36 billion dollars, outperforming the broader crypto market, which rose by 20%. Network activity, institutional participation, and technical upgrades all moved forward in sync.\n\nWhat excites me most about this report is that it validates what many of us who follow Polygon closely have been sensing. After a few years of searching for direction, Polygon has rediscovered its identity and is executing with focus. The growth across payments, real-world assets, and interoperability shows a network building for real adoption rather than temporary hype.\n\nHistory Lesson - Polygon was one of the most prominent blockchains during 2021 and 2022. Back then, MATIC was a household name in crypto. DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and gaming applications all flocked to Polygon. It was fast, cheap, and part of Ethereum’s scaling future.\n\nThen the market cooled, prices dropped, and Polygon’s identity blurred. It continued shipping technology, but the narrative was less defined. The ecosystem became large, but scattered, and the token’s performance reflected that uncertainty.\n\nIn 2025, that changed. Polygon refocused around two themes with real-world traction: payments and real-world assets. This focus unified its ecosystem under one clear goal of building the financial and transactional backbone for onchain economies. The Messari data shows that this strategy is working. Stablecoin growth, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure upgrades are moving together.\n\nThe chain has a strong foundation and a clear direction. The 39% market-cap surge in Q3 is the first tangible signal that the market recognizes that turnaround. To me, it feels like the beginning of Polygon’s second act.\n\nThe market performance in Q3 represents renewed confidence in execution. POL now ranks as the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 token by market capitalization, behind Mantle and ahead of Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. More than 99% of the supply has transitioned from MATIC to POL, completing one of the largest token migrations in the industry.\n\nPolygon’s outperformance is supported by onchain metrics. Daily active addresses increased by 13%, daily transactions rose 20%, and the average transaction fee declined by 23% in POL terms. These metrics indicate expanding usage and improving efficiency at the same time.\n\nWhen I look at these numbers, I see a market beginning to price real fundamentals again. The price action is following execution, which is what sustainable growth looks like.\n\nPolygon’s payments ecosystem is one of the strongest indicators of real adoption. In Q3, stablecoin supply increased 22% to $2.94 billion. USDT alone grew 35% to $1.4B, while USDC maintained close to $1B.\n\nMore importantly, those stablecoins are being used. Payments-focused applications on Polygon facilitated $1.82B in transaction volume across more than 50 platforms during the quarter, up 49% from Q2.\n\nPolygon has also become a hub for innovative payments infrastructure. What excites me most about this growth is that it represents genuine economic activity. They are transfers, purchases, and settlements happening on a scalable blockchain that costs a fraction of a cent per transaction. This is what a functional onchain payments network looks like.\n\nIf payments show real consumer traction, real-world assets show that institutions are taking Polygon seriously. The total value of tokenized RWAs on Polygon reached $1.14B (recently grew to $1.6B last week) by the end of Q3. The issuers include government agencies, state banks, and regulated financial entities.\n\nGermany’s NRW Bank issued a 100 million euro bond on Polygon under electronic securities law. Spain’s BeToken launched one of Europe’s first fully regulated equity token offerings. The Philippines Department of Budget and Management implemented a blockchain-based system to track public funds, improving transparency in government spending. Justoken launched tokens backed by physical commodities such as soybeans and soybean oil, with a combined value of over $450M.\n\nThese projects mark a shift from experimentation to production. Institutions are using Polygon for financial instruments that carry legal and regulatory weight. This is the kind of adoption that builds long-term credibility. When state banks and government agencies issue assets on a public chain, it changes the perception of blockchain entirely.\n\nFor me, this is one of the most exciting parts of the Polygon story in 2025. Real capital is entering the ecosystem, and it is doing so on Polygon because of its reliability, low cost, and Ethereum alignment.\n\nWhile institutional adoption is accelerating, developer momentum has been equally strong. Polygon ranks fourth in global blockchain developer interest in 2025, behind Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. This shows that the ecosystem continues to attract new builders even as competition increases.\n\nThe Agglayer Incubator Program has become a central piece of this growth. The Agglayer connects multiple chains into a unified liquidity network, creating an environment where assets and users move seamlessly between ecosystems. \n\nSeveral breakout projects have emerged from this initiative. Katana, a DeFi-optimized Layer 2 chain, launched earlier this year with deep liquidity and sustainable yield mechanisms. Miden continues to advance zero-knowledge virtual machine research. Billions focuses on institutional DeFi infrastructure, while other projects explore areas such as onchain identity and privacy.\n\nThis expanding network of independent but interoperable chains is what sets Polygon apart in 2025. It is not competing to be a single chain; it is building an interconnected ecosystem under the Agglayer framework.\n\nPolygon’s resurgence is also visible in its community engagement. **On October 1, 2025, Polygon became the first blockchain to formally sponsor and participate in** r/CryptoCurrency **as a Community Sponsor.** They are officially a sponsor of this subreddit and have distributed $5000 in POL rewards to users of the sub.\n\nAccording to Surf AI’s (another AMA participant) sentiment analysis, Polygon leads all Layer 2 solutions in positive Reddit discussions, with 78 percent bullish mentions compared to 62 percent for competitors. This shows that sentiment around Polygon has turned positive again as users see progress across the ecosystem.\n\nThe renewed focus on education and open communication reflects Polygon’s effort to focusing meaningfully in crypto communities and cultures. I view this community alignment as a strong sign of maturity.\n\nSeveral major developments this quarter have strengthened Polygon’s position further.\n\n* **Institutional Staking:** AMINA Bank launched regulated POL staking on October 9, 2025, offering compliant yield opportunities for institutional investors. This could unlock large amounts of capital from entities that have been waiting for regulatory clarity.\n* **Polymarket Expansion:** Polymarket, one of the most active applications on Polygon, saw its trading volume increase tenfold year over year in 2025. It now represents a significant share of Polygon’s DeFi activity and recently completed a $2B raise at a $9B valuation.\n* **Developer and Institutional Leadership:** Polygon continues to attract developers and enterprises alike through programs such as the Agglayer Incubator.\n* **Vitalik Buterin’s Endorsement:** In mid-October 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly praised Polygon’s contributions to Ethereum scalability and its early leadership in zero-knowledge research.\n\nOne of the most exciting developments this week is Polygon Labs’ collaboration with Manifold Trading, a quantitative investment firm specializing in institutional-grade liquidity. This partnership represents a major leap toward professional market standards in decentralized finance.\n\nManifold will bring data-driven liquidity management, quantitative market-making, and tighter spreads to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. In traditional markets, firms like Manifold ensure smooth execution and consistent pricing across venues. That structure has largely been missing in DeFi, where liquidity often sits idle or fragmented across decentralized exchanges.\n\nBy applying institutional execution practices to onchain markets, Polygon and Manifold are building a system that offers predictable depth and lower slippage. For context, compressing the spread on a one-million-dollar trade from 50 basis points to 5 basis points can save more than 4,000 dollars in execution costs. Scaled across billions in trading volume, these efficiencies make DeFi truly investable at institutional scale.\n\nManifold’s strategies will operate across Polygon’s major decentralized exchanges to harmonize pricing and ensure new markets launch with meaningful depth from day one.\n\nFor fintechs and neobanks exploring onchain payments or tokenized asset trading, the benefits are immediate. Polygon’s network can now deliver the execution quality and stability of traditional financial systems while maintaining the transparency and openness of DeFi.\n\nThis is a direct extension of the vision Polygon has been building toward all year. With infrastructure capable of 5,000-plus transactions per second, sub-five-second finality, and unified cross-chain liquidity through the Agglayer, the network is becoming a full-stack solution for global payments and institutional finance. The Manifold partnership makes that vision tangible by turning liquidity itself into an institutional-grade product.\n\nPolygon’s infrastructure progress has been equally important. The Bhilai Hardfork, Heimdall v2, and Rio Testnet upgrades have all delivered major performance improvements.\n\nThe Bhilai Hardfork increased throughput to over 1,000 transactions per second, raised the block gas limit, and implemented account abstraction through EIP-7702. Heimdall v2 reduced transaction finality from one to two minutes down to approximately five seconds by upgrading the consensus layer. The Rio Testnet, which is moving toward mainnet, introduces stateless verification and validator redesigns that could enable up to 5,000 transactions per second.\n\nPolygon also launched Agglayer CDK Enterprise, a toolkit that allows institutions to deploy privacy-enabled EVM chains that remain interoperable with the main ecosystem. This combination of scalability, privacy, and interoperability is a major step toward institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAverage transaction fees have dropped to roughly 0.0027 dollars, making Polygon one of the most efficient networks in the space. For payments and RWAs, those economics are critical.\n\nPolygon’s 2025 story is one of renewal. The network has moved from a period of uncertainty to a position of clear strength. Its focus on payments, real-world assets, and interoperability has created measurable growth across both retail and institutional segments.\n\nThe community is re-engaged, the developer base is expanding, and institutions are beginning to trust Polygon for real financial applications. The Messari report captures this turning point with data, but the larger narrative is about execution and focus.\n\nThe 39% rise in market capitalization in Q3 is, in my view, only an early indication of what lies ahead. Polygon has rebuilt its foundation, aligned its strategy with real demand, and positioned itself at the center of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Polygon could become one of the most important networks in the next phase of blockchain adoption.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oil6xd/polygon_has_supported_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_im/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline.\n\nThat’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie.\n\nContext matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters.\n\nThe bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades.\n\nOne interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end.\n\nMy read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon.

IonQ timeline is way ahed of NIST's deadline.\n\nI also liked that he spelt it out: those acting dismissively have invariably never had any real understanding of quantum computing.\n\nIn the meantime, keep buying Bitcoin.\n\nEDIT: A good review of the current (Sep 2025) post-quantum migration landscape for a few major blockchains, including ECDSA based ones (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) and EdDSA ones (Solana, Sui, Aptos, etc), is: *\"Post-Quantum Blockchain: Transition Landscape Amidst Evolving Complexity\"* https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1626 (thanks u/Tsmacks1 for the pointer). Some of the references in there are also good reads.\n\nCrypto bros have traditionally dismissed it all and also claimed \"The world will have much bigger problems if RSA or ECC is cracked.\" which is funny when you think about it, because out of all the big &amp; high stake systems you could attack,  a crypto network would likely be one of the first, simply because attacking other big &amp; high stake systems has a higher risk of sending you to jail. In other words, the other big systems have an inherent higher level of protection.\n\nThe problem of \"lost\" coins is a big one, as those aren't protected. People no longer in control of private keys (lost, dead, etc) will not be able to upgrade, so their coins will be available to crackers. Devs can theoretically block those addresses but that's a big pandora's box and I don't see it happening in Bitcoin as it would undermine the whole thesis of \"nobody controls Bitcoin\" (plus devs don't actually know if an address is dead). They possibly could add functionality to the chain such that a quantum private key derived from a classic key can unlock the funds, giving the true owner a bit of time to claim their coins before crackers get to it.\n\nLost coins have no legislation protecting them. If you crack it, it's yours. Cracking equipment at first will only be available to QC manufacturers themselves, then big corps, then governments, before organized crime and smaller crime can afford/get their hands on it.

It’s now my full time job.\n\nBut I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders.\n\nI also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward.

A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.\n\nFed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators.\n\n* AI + Payments: The Fed’s hyped on AI for fraud, risk, and routing, perfect for programmable L1s and L2s like Ethereum.\n* Ethereum’s Throne: With \\~60% of DeFi’s TVL, ETH’s liquidity, tooling, and institutional heft make it the king of this shift.\n\nAltcoin Season Is Coming!\n\nThe Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.\n\nWhy Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment.\n\nWhat’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti. But the Fed’s moving fast, and DeFi’s in the driver’s seat. Watch Ethereum, compliant stablecoins, and altcoins building for the long game. Altcoin season is coming, the fuse is lit.\n\nAlways be mindful that news can be overhyped. Invest wisely by DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk . Keep an eye on ETH as a market leader, it hasn’t made a durable break above its ATH yet.

I have to admit, I'm kind of a fan of PAXG.  PAXG if you don't know is an ERC-20 coin soft-pegged to gold.  I've held it for quite a while as my long term flight to safety when not actively trading.  That kind of worked out in my favor recently.  I'm glad I wasn't trading.\n\nI'll tell you what I don't like about it.  Pretty expensive to move around.  We are talking like $3.  Now in the grand scheme of things that's tiny.  But what I mean by this is I wish it wasn't just a decent value store.  I wish it was transactable.\n\nNow this is where I'm going to date how up to date my knowledge is.  Not very.  I nerded out on crypto quite a while ago and then didn't keep up.  Hence the question.\n\nIn theory there are wrappers that could make it transactable.  Probably more wrappers than an old hat like me could keep track of.  The question is what would actually be good?  I know polygon, solana, and avalanche are used to wrap things.  No matter what is picked there can be more that one route to actual funding.  One could do a bridge that would incur the high paxg fees at least.  One could exchange it on a dex.  But then you have to find a dex that has decent activity for what is fairly obscure.  I would argue it shouldn't be.  I wish wrapped PAXG was a common coin.\n\nThat's why it's worth asking the new hats.  I probably sound like I know more than I do.  I'm a technical dude but with the last few years of crypto I've mostly just kept up with vocab.  That's a pretty shallow level of understanding.  I'm confident in my technical abilities enough to admit when my understanding is shallow in an area.\n\nI do think gold is going to keep going up long term.  And the demand for exchange in gold is going to go up even faster than that.  The perceived future demand for gold based transaction is leading the price.  I also think that crypto is about to hit another period of significant volatility, more so than recent.  In what direction I don't know, but I fear it might be down.  More institutions that need to exchange real value are having to do it more often as they are being confronted with the real-politik of the current era.\n\nWe are now in an era of massive transition.  We think AI is causing a lot of transition in our lives but these transitions aren't isolated to us.  Some of the most core institutions are finding themselves in fast moving times compared to what they are used to.  Their standard rate of change is usually akin to molasses or pitch.  We have fiat currencies coming out of existence, like the Argentine peso, and CBDC being attempted, BRICS trying to be a thing, state sponsored resource competition to get the hardware setup for AI, and proxy conflicts between major powers.  And these institutions need to exchange real value when they make changes at the lowest level.  Just like we can exchange on-chain and off-chain, institutions have on-chain and off-chain.  And they have more demand to do more on-chain activity than they have in the past or think that they may need to do on-chain activity in the near future.  And on-chain for them is gold.\n\nMeanwhile on the consumer end, with attempts to create CBDC, many are going to want to prefer solutions they own to do the same thing.  People are going to want to do fast and convenient crypto.  And they are going to want to do it with more stability with something people recognize as having value and governments and institutions recognize as having value being a bonus.  And as mentioned before governments and institutions will very much be recognizing gold.\n\nAn era of gold may be upon us, if we want it.  If we can only get the transactability working smooth.  So let's figure it out.  Let's figure out what we are doing and what the standard is to move gold from phone to phone as fast as possible with the lowest fees.  The more of us that know what that standard is the more of us can do it and lead that standard.  This can be a good foot wedged in door alternative to CBDC.  And if we move fast and get that food in the door quickly we can keep the world crypto and free instead of CBDC and controlled.  It also may be harder for government to fight it economically if it exchanges something they themselves need to recognize.\n\nSo back to the technical side.

Assumedly these companies would have to sell the treasury asset to repay antsy trad-fi investors creating further downward pressure on their and other crypto treasury companies holdings.\n\n# Alts\n\nObviously this scenario would be extremely concerning for treasury companies focusing on alts which might have limited liquidity (see the recent flash crash against all alts last week).

Could either drop enough that treasury companies would be forced to sell causing cascading losses across the entire crypto industry?\n\n\\------\n\nI don't know the answer, I'm sure some people here are very familiar with the topic and could answer that.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1o8gnmj", "author": "vantage7", "handle": "vantage7", "created_utc": 1760644986.0, "text": "Pyth Network Industries I was talking to AI about what future the Pyth Network could hold after partnering with Kalshi and AI got me thinking after this response.\n\nPyth Network’s ultra-low latency oracle infrastructure, capable of delivering price and event data updates in milliseconds, uniquely positions it to transform multiple industries that rely on real-time external data. Traditionally concentrated in decentralized finance (DeFi), Pyth’s technology now has cross-industry potential across sectors requiring rapid, reliable, and verifiable data delivery. Here’s how Pyth can tap into key industries:\n\n\nFinancial Services and Trading:\n\nPyth’s origins and strengths lie in finance, where millisecond-level price feed speed is critical. High-frequency trading firms and market makers depend on instantaneous market data to exploit arbitrage opportunities and hedge risks. DeFi protocols—decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and derivatives markets—require real-time prices to execute trades, maintain liquidity, and trigger liquidations fairly. Pyth’s direct connection to institutional data sources gives it an edge in security, accuracy, and speed, offering a critical infrastructure for on-chain financial products to operate with traditional capital market-grade data quality and speed.\n\nGaming and Esports:\n\nThe blockchain gaming and esports industries increasingly integrate tokenized assets, NFTs, and betting mechanisms that require timely data for fairness and user experience. Pyth’s millisecond data updates enable live odds, event outcomes, and in-game asset valuations to reflect real-world changes instantly. This creates a more immersive and trustworthy ecosystem for gamers and betters by preventing stale or manipulated data from impacting outcomes. The speed and tamper-resistant nature of Pyth’s oracles can underpin transparent, decentralized gaming marketplaces and prediction platforms.\nSupply Chain and Logistics\nModern supply chains leverage IoT sensors and smart contracts to monitor inventory, shipments, and environmental factors. Pyth’s rapid data transmission can enhance supply chain responsiveness by feeding real-time sensor data on location, temperature, or humidity directly into smart contracts. This enables automated decision-making such as rerouting shipments, activating contractual penalties for delays, or adjusting inventory levels dynamically. By incorporating Pyth’s oracle network, supply chain platforms can achieve greater transparency and efficiency in global trade flows.\n\nEnergy and Utilities:\n\nEnergy grids need to balance supply and demand continuously, a task made more complex by renewables like solar and wind that fluctuate rapidly. Pyth could provide low-latency weather data and sensor feeds to grid operators, enabling real-time adjustments in generation and distribution. This helps mitigate blackouts, optimize renewable usage, and integrate decentralized energy sources. The transparency and auditability of blockchain combined with Pyth’s fast oracles could also improve market operations in energy trading and decentralized utilities.\n\nSports Betting and Prediction Markets:\n\nIn sports betting and prediction markets, millisecond updates on event data, player stats, and odds determine fair pricing and reduce arbitrage risks. Pyth’s ability to deliver trusted, direct data feeds on-chain rapidly can revolutionize decentralized sports betting with fairer markets and real-time odds adjustments. This benefits both operators and bettors with enhanced market efficiency and reduced risk of manipulation or stale information.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles and IoT:\n\nThe emerging autonomous vehicle industry and IoT ecosystems require real-time sensor and environmental data to operate safely and efficiently. Pyth’s low-latency oracle feeds could deliver verifiable external inputs such as traffic data, weather conditions, and enterprise asset status directly to control systems or smart contracts managing automated processes. This would improve safety, reduce latency in decision-making, and create more efficient operational frameworks.\n\nIn conclusion, Pyth Network’s millisecond-level price and event data feeds provide a strong foundation for transforming a broad range of industries beyond DeFi. Its unique combination of speed, accuracy, security, and decentralized governance equips it to support new classes of applications that demand timely, reliable data integration. By tapping into finance, gaming, logistics, energy, betting, and IoT, Pyth can enable innovative business models, improved operational efficiencies, and greater transparency across sectors reliant on real-world data.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o8gnmj/pyth_network_industries/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Those investors aren’t sitting on the sidelines waiting to gamble. They’re chasing safe yield they can actually trust.\n\nSame mindset has already spilled into crypto. You can see it in how capital is moving right now. More people are parking stablecoins in places that earn: lending protocols, tokenized treasuries, on-chain credit markets.\n\nDeFi lending deposits have been growing faster than the overall crypto market cap. So even when prices stall, yield products are still pulling in capital.\n\nProjects like Ondo, Maple, and Aave are basically becoming crypto’s version of money markets. Tokenized treasuries, short-term credit, stablecoin pools. This is how yield-focused investors are dipping into crypto without even touching volatile assets.\n\nFeels like the early signs of maturity. The tools are getting cleaner, the risk frameworks are improving, and DeFi is starting to look less like a casino and more like an income engine.\n\nAll my crypto friends have stopped talking about meme coins and started obsessing over farming and yield opportunities. \n\nSo maybe the next bull run isn’t about wild speculation.

Data shared by CoinShares head of research, James Butterfill, shows that global crypto ETPs have attracted roughly $48.7 billion so far in 2025, beating last year’s $44.2 billion total. The momentum highlights growing institutional confidence and sustained interest in regulated crypto investment vehicles.\n\nThe surge builds on a massive $5.95 billion inflow recorded just last week, one of the largest weekly totals ever. Bitcoin continues to dominate, pulling in around $30 billion in new capital, though its share of the total is starting to slip as investors diversify beyond BTC. This shift suggests that institutional portfolios are gradually opening up to broader crypto exposure.\n\nEther and several altcoins like COAI on BNB chain have seen notable growth after exchanges support and  poolx during the same period, can't say if the btc pool on some like bitget before the new BTC ATH is still contributing to a more balanced inflow distribution across the market.

As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn’t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they’re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) – Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) – Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) – Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the “revenue” comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don’t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it’s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there’s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that’s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There’s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem’s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK &amp; Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.", "lang": null, "likes": 4, "replies": 14, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0s90f/deep_dive_into_nonbtc_dats/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients’ addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don’t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 17, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

You have probably heard of Hype by now, I'm not an expert but from what I understands it's a blockchain that specializes on DEX leverage trading (a perp dex). From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume.

The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 20, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Since then, we’ve:\n\n• Launched PineappleDEX Lite, and now rolled out the full PineappleDEX with CEX-grade limit orders\n\n• Continued to develop $PAPPLE utility, with stakers able to earn up to 15% APY, access to new token launches, and exclusive events. And soon, you’ll be able to spend $PAPPLE at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide\n\n• Integrated Solana, joining BNB, Ethereum, and Base, with many more chains to come\n\n• Opened Pineapple Mansion: our members-only ecosystem where top-tier stakers gain exclusive access to AMAs, private events, and luxury perks\n\n• Announced the first project launching through Pineapple Express (our community-first incubation and launchpad platform): a Harvard-backed team building the future of decentralized healthcare. Full details coming this Friday!\n\n• Partnered with Aaron Ramsey, ex-Arsenal, Juventus, and Welsh national team footballer with a global audience exceeding 2 billion across his channels and partnerships\n\n• Became the official exchange partner of Polaris, the fastest-growing combat sports league with hundreds of millions of viewers annually, and a presence on UFC Fight Pass\n\n• Brought on almost a dozen Conor McGregor-backed BKFC fighters as ambassadors, and even hosted a private yacht event for our top stakers and whales.\n\nWe’ve been called one of the most active and innovative teams in DeFi - not just in product delivery, but in partnerships, marketing, and community building.\n\nNow, we’re here to share what’s next - and trust me, there’s a lot just around the corner.

I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here’s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50–60% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about “supply shock” and “institutional demand.” Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the “smart money” and the “supply shock” narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that’s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that’s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn’t disappeared. It’s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that “the macro environment is too tough” doesn’t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn’t (only) the economy, it’s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That’s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and “institutional adoption” story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every “strong project” will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn’t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, “Is this really it?”\n\nIf ETH and alts don’t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won’t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto’s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic “BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; alts” rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don’t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "lang": null, "likes": 624, "replies": 579, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve been kicking this idea around for a while: if you were to launch your own crypto project from scratch, what would you actually do to give the coin real market value and not just pump-and-dump hype?\n\nMost new coins seem to follow the same tired playbook: spin up a catchy name, throw together a whitepaper, raise some money, list on a few DEXes, hope for a pump on Twitter, and then watch interest fade after a few weeks. That’s obviously not sustainable. I’m curious about the people here who think about the long game.\n\nIf you were in charge, how would you approach it? Would you focus on:\n\nUtility: A lot of coins die because they don’t do anything useful. Would you design it around a specific problem, maybe payments, gaming, privacy, DeFi, or something entirely different?\n\nTokenomics: Would you prioritize fair distribution, low inflation, or something like a burn mechanism to control supply? Maybe staking rewards to keep holders engaged?\n\nLiquidity &amp; Listings: We all know exchange access matters. Would you try to get on every CEX you can early on, or focus on building liquidity pools on DeFi first?\n\nCommunity: Some projects live or die by their community. Would you prioritize building an engaged user base first, think memes, community voting, regular updates or do you think community only matters once there’s actual utility?\n\nPartnerships &amp; Real-World Use: This is where I see a lot of coins fall short. Beyond airdrops and influencer shilling, what about partnerships with businesses or apps where the coin could actually be used?\n\nMarketing vs. Building: The classic debate: do you spend early energy on marketing hype to get people in the door, or quietly build and launch with a working product before going loud?\n\nPersonally, I think too many projects skip over the fundamentals. Everyone wants a moonshot chart, but few want to do the boring work: sustainable tokenomics, real-world use cases, proper liquidity strategy, and a solid long-term plan for how the token integrates into whatever ecosystem you’re building.\n\nSo I’m throwing it out to the community: if you were given the chance to create a new crypto from zero, how would you try to make it valuable over the next 5+ years?\n\nWhat’s the first thing you’d focus on?\nWhat’s the mistake you’d avoid at all costs?\nAny unconventional tactics that you think could really move the needle?", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 40, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwmddc/if_you_started_your_own_crypto_project_how_would/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Memecoins… I know what you’re probably thinking when you read that word. And yes, most of your preconceptions are correct. A large portion of this industry, especially when you consider the capital involved, revolves around pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nIn fact, I recently came across more than one confession on Reddit from self-proclaimed pump-and-dump operators. From organized KOL gangs to small-time celebrities, and even highly technical individuals with automated toolkits — most of them operate on Solana. And the majority use the **Pump\\[dot\\]fun** platform.\n\nOne Reddit user in particular, u/JewelTamexJuno, caught my attention because of the level of detail he revealed during an AMA. He also seemed to have a thinly veiled agenda of selling his own toolkit, which he described as including:\n\n* Volume bot\n* X tracker\n* AI API with his own LLM\n* Private RPC (likely a rented dedicated node)\n* New trader alert bot\n* Sniper bot\n\nAs anyone familiar with web3 will notice, none of this is groundbreaking. Some tools are even free or easy to adapt. Others cost just a few dollars. With less than $100, anyone could piece together a similar setup, even without coding skills — with a bit of effort, of course.\n\nHe even outlined his script, which goes something like this:\n\n* X trackers monitor large accounts (e.g., Elon, Presidents, major CT figures).\n* An account tweets an image (for example, Elon Musk posting a Doge on the moon).\n* His bot detects the image and instantly creates a memecoin around it, with AI generating the name.\n* He buys a chunk of the supply and runs volume bots.\n* Retail traders jump in.\n* He dumps.\n\nHe also dropped this gem of his wisdom:\n\n“*Everyone knows that newly created coins based on trends can rug at any time, making it a race for manual traders.*”\n\nThis is a snapshot of how one individual can manipulate the system — not because he’s a genius, but because the entire environment makes it possible. Beyond individuals, I also saw mob-like operations involving KOLs running secret Telegram groups, coordinating manual pumps, and creating ponzi-like subgroup structures where insiders grabbed the biggest slice. Again, not sophisticated — just organized extraction.\n\nAnd let’s not even start with celebrities and nation-state presidents orchestrating their own pump-and-dumps. We’ve seen enough to understand that the **Solana ecosystem is saturated with mafia-style groups and bot armies**, all dressed up as “fun” memecoins.\n\nBut are people really having fun? Is there anything authentic to this narrative, or is it just another layer of extractive nonsense?\n\n\\[This is small part of my article \"[Are you laughing?](https://substack.com/home/post/p-175103381) [The way to have fun with memecoins like a builder](https://substack.com/inbox/post/175103381?r=23szg&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&amp;triedRedirect=true)\" just click the link if you want to read the full story and discover one or two new things, but i REALLY want to start a discussion here, it's not a engagement/subscriber farming post.

In this education post, I will be exploring incentive platforms that provide additional rewards beyond standard yield farming approaches and how users can compound rewards. These platforms assist protocols in bootstrapping liquidity through boosted incentives, points, or campaigns, offering users improved returns with minimal added risk.\n\nI will be examining Merkl, Fuul, and Turtle.\n\nThis is NFA and before allocating to these protocols, you should DYOR.\n\nI am not financially compensated from the 3 protocols and do not have official relationships with them, I simply have used the protocols and had good experiences.\n\nOne big piece of alpha: none of the platforms have launched a token yet, but we know so many platforms eventually do drop a token. Early participation may qualify users for potential airdrops or rewards before saturation occurs. Merkl, Fuul, and Turtle.xyz currently have no live tokens, though Turtle announced $TURTLE on September 29, 2025, with launch details forthcoming. Merkl and Fuul have not indicated tokens publicly, but DeFi platforms often reward early users retroactively and engaging prior to announcements when competition is lower can be advantageous.\n\nPlatforms like these can be extremely lucrative, especially Turtle.xyz, by stacking multiple reward layers on stable or low-risk positions. I am personally using Turtle.xyz before the airdrop, farming stablecoins on Katana.  Turtle has a liquidity leaderboard and is airdropping to the top 1000 on their liquidity leaderboard, which currently requires just over $500.  No idea how much this will be worth on TGE, but if you’re already yield farming on TAC, Katana, or Linea, might as well pick up some free rewards.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: There are liquidity farming, incentive-as-a-service platforms that add incentives to attract TVL and give users increased yields. Early use may yield benefits from future token drops.\n\n**Platform Overviews**\n\nThese function as incentives-as-a-service tools, enabling protocols to run targeted campaigns for liquidity attraction. Users deposit or provide liquidity, receiving base yields plus additional points or rewards. This aids chains and apps in bootstrapping without rapid emission depletion, while expanding user compounding options.\n\n* Merkl: Backed by a16z, Merkl is an incentive and points management platform for custom campaigns across over 50 chains. It has distributed more than $200M in incentives, with partners including Aave, Compound, Katana, Morpho, Uniswap, Euler, and PancakeSwap. Integrations on Arbitrum and Optimism facilitate stacking rewards on lending or LP positions.\n* Fuul: Fuul offers tools for incentive programs paid in points or tokens. It has generated over $4B in trading volume from dYdX referrals, plus contributions to Vertex (30% of early trading volume) and Resolv. Partners include dYdX, Vertex, Resolv, Dune, Base, and Arbitrum. It supports no-code campaigns for trading, lending, and liquidity provisioning.\n* **Turtle.xyz**: Turtle.xyz routes deposits to partners through campaigns and a leaderboard. It has handled over $5B in liquidity and accumulated a multi-million-dollar treasury from contributions. Deposits are straightforward, with $524 currently sufficient for top 1000 leaderboard placement. Partners include Linea, Katana, Lombard, Etherfi, Renzo, Scroll, TAC, and over 30 others such as PancakeSwap and Swell. For BTCfi users, LBTC deposits on Katana earn Lux Points, potentially qualifying for $BARD airdrops, so you can basically triple-dip here.\n\n**Significance for DeFi Users**\n\nIn a competitive environment, these platforms enhance efficiency by aligning incentives. Protocols are willing to pay to gain increased TVL for growth, while users receive amplified returns. This creates a sustainable ecosystem dynamic. With no tokens launched yet (except Turtle's upcoming one), current involvement offers opportunities for retrospective rewards.\n\nFor DeFi users, this trend indicates that projects and chains are increasingly willing to pay extra through boosted incentives and campaigns to attract users and liquidity. This ultimately benefits participants with higher yields and airdrop qualifications. Users win.  \n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this is that institutions are also engaging with these platforms. For example, Turtle.xyz has attracted institutional investors like Susquehanna International Group, signaling a broader shift in TradFi's openness to onchain activities and integration with DeFi.\n\nThese developments reflect DeFi's maturation, where sophisticated incentive layers allow users to stack rewards across multiple protocols and chains, democratizing access to opportunities that were once limited to large players. This fosters greater innovation and competition among ecosystems, as chains vie for capital with structured campaigns rather than relying on volatile token emissions. For everyday users, it means more ways to optimize portfolios and combine base APYs with points, leaderboards, and potential airdrops.  These potentially compounded gains in a low-effort manner leads to better and better rewards. As institutional adoption grows, it could further stabilize liquidity pools and introduce new asset classes, pointing to a more resilient and expansive DeFi landscape overall.\n\nAdoption is increasing as protocols integrate these tools. For those farming yields, incorporating them can elevate APYs.\n\n\n\nAgain, this isn’t meant as financial advice, but more highlighting how defi users can improve their yield and gains through these incentive-as-a-service liquidity providing platforms.", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nunyq2/defi_education_liquidity_coordination_platforms/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve been looking at how consistently profitable traders operate and a lot of them DCA instead of timing entries. Makes sense: you smooth volatility and remove emotion.\n\nExecution is the interesting part. Most people use Coinbase or Kraken recurring buys...simple, but fees/spreads can add up. I’ve been using Jupiter on Solana for on-chain DCA: set an interval and it routes across DEXs for best price. Way more flexible than most CEX options. Downside: you need to manage SOL for gas and on-chain failures/alerts.\n\nTax reality (US): buying crypto with fiat is not a taxable event. Weekly DCA creates lots of purchases to track for basis, but you don’t have a taxable event until you dispose (sell/trade/spend). On-chain, the gas you pay in SOL is a small taxable disposal of that SOL at its FMV when paid. That’s minor per tx, but real.\n\nBecause DCA multiplies transactions, crypto tax software isn’t optional once volume rises. You’ll want clean lot tracking (Specific ID/HIFO if you can substantiate, otherwise FIFO), fee roll-in to basis, and exports that won’t wreck your 8949 when you eventually sell.\n\nawaken.tax pulls your CEX and wallets, links internal transfers, applies your chosen lot method, and produces clean Form 8949 exports so your DCA doesn’t turn into spreadsheet purgatory at filing time.\n\nMy current setup: weekly BTC/ETH buys, bi-weekly SOL via Jupiter for alts. Took ~30 minutes to configure; then it runs.\n\nAnyone else running DCA? What cadence are you using, and are you staying on CEX for simplicity or going on-chain for flexibility?

I've spent some time exploring their docs, blogs, and setup. \n\nTL;DR - It's a Layer-1 project focused on privacy and post-quantum security. It's still early, but very reminiscent of other privacy coins that started out with limited buzz but interesting innovation. \n\n# What Neptune Cash Is All About\n\nAt its core, Neptune Cash is a peer-to-peer anonymous cash protocol built as a Layer-1 blockchain. It uses zk-STARKs integrated right at the base layer, which means users handle transaction proofs on their end, miners aggregate everything into one big block with a single proof. This keeps the chain succinct and scalable without bloating.\n\nThe standout for me is the privacy aspect. Transactions are fully anonymous by default, using mutator sets (a fresh approach to zero-knowledge that maintains privacy with full verifiability). It's designed for fungible cash-like transfers, and it also supports private smart contracts with arbitrary logic. This means it can be used in DeFi or apps and your portfolio stays hidden. \n\nCompared to something like Monero, which relies on ring signatures, this setup feels more efficient for scaling while keeping things untraceable. A\n\nFor post-quantum security, it is baked in from the start. All the cryptography is resistant to quantum attacks, meaning future upgrades or risks of a supply shock if quantum computers advance stay off the table. Neptune is quantum-secure at genesis, which is different than other projects where they would fix the quantum problem through forking the chain with the patch upgrades. This approach which positions Neptune for long-term usage in a world where privacy tech faces bigger threats down the line.\n\n# The Team Behind It\n\nAlan Szepieniec serves as the lead researcher. He holds a PhD in post-quantum cryptography from the University of Leuven in Belgium, works as a researcher at the Nervos Foundation, and founded AS Discrete Mathematics GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. He has authored numerous scientific papers, with key contributions including DARK/Supersonic (SNARKs without trusted setups using novel mathematics) and Rescue &amp; Rescue-Prime (hash functions widely adopted for zero-knowledge proofs). \n\nThorkil Værge is the other founder. He holds an MSc in Physics from the University of Copenhagen and brings over seven years of experience in blockchain technology. He has contributed to the specifications of the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin Lightning Network, built core blockchain implementations for companies like BitGo, Bitcoin Suisse, and Inacta, and created a compiler for specifying financial contracts on Ethereum.\n\nSuper a research-heavy team, with the project representing five years of dedicated R&amp;D. This project took a long time to ship, but personally, I appreciate the dedication to solid technical achievements.\n\n# Tokenomics and Mechanics\n\nToken is $NPT, with a total supply capped at 42 million – similar to Bitcoin's model but with tweaks. Halvings every three years, starting from 128 per block. Half of mining rewards are locked for three years, which aligns miners with long-term holding rather than quick actions. Premine is under 2%, and the design is deflationary over time.\n\nMining is Proof-of-Work, but memory-hard (needs about 40GB RAM for efficiency), which levels the field against botnets and ASICs. It got hit by a botnet early on (common issue for PoW chains), leading to a relaunch in August 2025 with the upgraded algo. Now it's more decentralized and resistant. If you're into mining, it's CPU/GPU friendly. The adoption is low and growing organically, like early privacy coins where miners were the first users.\n\n# Ways to participate\n\nAfter the AMA, I set up a node and wallet to poke around. Here's the practical side:\n\n* Wallet and Node: Download the core software from their GitHub (neptune-core). It's CLI-based for now – run commands to generate a wallet and sync the chain. Syncing is fast thanks to the recursive proofs; validating the whole history is basically instant.\n* Mining: If you want to try, install the core, configure your wallet, and point it at a pool or solo mine. Their docs cover it – it's straightforward if you're used to PoW setups. Usage is still early, but contributors are popping up because the tech is appealing for privacy-focused builds.\n* Acquiring $NPT: Only on SafeTrade right now (NPT-USDT pair). Liquidity is thin, so limit orders are key to avoid slippage. DEX is on the roadmap.\n* Resources: YouTube is great for explainers &amp; the explorer lets you view blocks without revealing privacy details.\n\nFrom what I've seen, adoption is in that bootstrapping phase. Usage starting with miners and devs but showing a lot of promise. Privacy and future-proofing are the core strengths, and it's worth exploring. I've learned a ton just setting it up.

A couple months ago, Teller ran AMA on this subreddit and since then it’s become one of the protocols I use the most.\n\nBullet points on features I like\n\n* TellerGPT – Amazing for DeFi users. I don't know why every platform doesn't do this. I get a daily email with live pool conditions, yields, and borrowing options. It saves me a ton of time since I don’t have to check every dashboard on the platoform and  can just scan my inbox and know where the best opportunities are.\n* Incentivized supply side yields – So I am a big time katana user. Right now I’m earning \\~25% APY on a couple assets (USDC &amp; POL) simply by supplying the asset. The rewards are in-kind which is also really nice and avoids the BS that a lot of other lending protocols use.  The incentives make supplying compelling because the yield scales with borrowing demand, and it’s single-asset so I don’t deal with impermanent loss.\n* No direct liquidations – This is a massive differentiator. On Aave, Morpho, Compound, etc, if your collateral value drops too much, you get liquidated. This means is you're close to to your max LTV, you're constantly chart watching and nervous.  But with Teller, loans run on 30-day checkpoints, meaning as long as you pay the interest, your position stays open. If you miss the checkpoint, collateral goes into a Dutch auction where users bid on the collateral to reimburse the lenders. It’s way less stressful and lets you ride out volatility without getting wrecked by a random wick.\n\nThe last point is why Teller feels different to me. Aave, Morpho, and Compound are great, but they’re designed around constant price-based liquidations. Teller flips that model with checkpoint-based loans, and in my opinion, it’s a much better fit for more advanced strategies.\n\nTo me, Teller is perfect for a DeFi-first heavy user as it's designed more for long-term lending &amp; borrowing strategies. \n\nA 30-day checkpoint is a really unique way to solve the high LTV problem in defi. Longer term, I think this model is set up well for on-chain credit systems once ZK-identity becomes more standard, as wallets can have credit scores attached to real identities (but obscured through zk-identity) meaning better borrowing terms for credible borrowers.  \n\nDisclaimer: NFA &amp; I wouldn’t recommend someone brand new to DeFi to dive in.

Just saw this coin the day before yesterday and bought at $1.7 I sold at $2.1 and made a 50 dollar profit. Recently, I’ve been thinking of changing strategy. My portfolio is 85-90% Litecoin (already sold my BTC, BNB, ETH, and SOL to buy Litecoin) because I think it’s pretty solid (commodity, fixed supply, fast, MWEB, treasuries, soon ETF, and most important, cheap). I’m of the philosophy of selling the winners to buy the losers because it’s easier for a 10B marketcap coin to double than it is for Bitcoin to do the same in the same timeframe. I think many people agree with this (otherwise, memecoins wouldn’t be so popular) and also that PoW coins with a fixed supply that have stayed in the market for more than a decade are solid investments. Unfortunately, my thesis proved wrong because LTC has underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, I’m not selling it this cheap and have already holded it from $50 to $114 to $50 to $140 to $70 to now. So I’ll just stay invested there. \n\nMy question though, is about the remaining 15% of my porftolio. My best investment was Injective which I bought with $500 (less than 1% of my portfolio) because I liked the logo and it did a 100x from $1 to $53. Following the same train of thought, I bought OSMO (a Cosmos coin) with part of the profits from INJ but it was the WORST investment. It’s breaking all time lows every day. It’s sitting at a 100M marketcap and I fear it will be delisted or the developers may abandon the project and leave it to die. I’m not a fan of selling coins cheap but I already lost faith in the coin because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or even Solana, it’s not of interest to any institution and doesn’t seem to have a floor. I was thinking of selling the OSMO to buy ASTER at $1.7.\n\nAster is pretty high in marketcap so in theory it’s harder to make a profit but a big marketcap can also be a positive because the coin has “proven itself” (psychology) and, most important, it’s backed by CZ. If he’s promoting it so much, it feels like a legit project. I don’t trust Binance with my life but the guy sent BNB from 10 cents to 1K and has built a crypto empire. I think $ASTER is here to stay and could double this year, if not more. And even if the bear market comes, I think it would drop less than OSMO. \n\nWhat do you guys think, should I pull the trigger and buy ASTER? Are you buying at these prices? Or are you out already? Or do you think it’s not a good project and better to just buy gold or have USDT? I need to make a 2X to recover my losses from OSMO.

On September 29 we launch Season 0, where we bootstrap network liquidity and align before the ICO. Ask us anything now and find out how to make the most of Season 0 before we go live on Sept 29.\n\n**What is Makina and why is it relevant to the sub?**  \nMakina is a DeFi Execution Engine that connects professional strategists (Operators) with onchain users through programmable vaults called Machines. The first Operator that will deploy on Makina will be Dialectic, an industry-leading crypto-native fund.Machines are designed for institutional-grade yield strategies that anyone with a wallet can access. Risk management is enforced onchain with pre-approved instructions, parameter caps, atomic unwinds, and a lot of other innovative tech.\n\nThis is relevant to the sub because it tackles issues that matter in DeFi today: yield, transparency, risk management, fair launches, and execution infrastructure.\n\n**What’s happening now?**  \nOn September 29 at 12:00 UTC we launch Season 0. This is your chance to acquire Machine Tokens (MT) and participate in Makina’s launch while earning:\n\n\\- Base yield from selected Morpho vaults (Steakhouse USDC, MEV Capital WETH, Gauntlet WBTC Core).\n\n\\- Tickets: Tickets give priority ICO access at $35M FDV (the same valuation as our strategic angel round).\n\n\\- Points: Points convert to $MAK tokens at TGE + leaderboard perksSeason 0 runs for 4 weeks. Early participation brings higher reward boosts. Your boost depends on when you join and how you position your Machine Tokens.\n\n**Why are we here?**  \nWe want to share details of how Season 0 works, explain why institutional-grade execution infrastructure is missing from today’s DeFi stack, and hear directly from the r/cryptocurrency community.\n\n**Topics we’d love to dive into (but not limited to):**\n\n\\- Mechanics of Makina’s Season 0, Tickets, Points, ICO, and Boosts.\n\n\\- What makes Makina uniquely positioned to transform DeFi operations? \n\n\\- Makina’s technical innovations.\n\n\\- Risk frameworks and Operator alignment.\n\n\\- How fair launch values shape the $MAK distribution.\n\n\\- The role of Machines in scaling cross-chain strategies.\n\n\\- What comes next after Season 0?\n\n*Season 0 is just the start. Positioning now means you'll be ahead of the curve for the Priority ICO*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfolsunjbcrf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=783d3ffc4726565cbed78413e19b5e1b92055d29", "lang": null, "likes": 4, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nqbof5/join_the_makina_ama_and_discover_the_defi/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}
