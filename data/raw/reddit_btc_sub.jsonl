Considering borrowing against my Bitcoin I've been holding Bitcoin for about 2 years now and it's done pretty well. Got about $8k worth currently. The thing is I need around $3-4k for some unexpected expenses but I really don't want to sell my Bitcoin because I'm bullish long-term and don't want to trigger a taxable event.\n\nSomeone mentioned crypto loans where you can borrow cash using your Bitcoin as collateral. Sounds interesting but I honestly don't understand how it works or if it's a good idea.\n\nFrom what I've pieced together:\n\n* You put up your crypto as collateral\n* They lend you cash (USD, EUR, whatever)\n* You pay interest on the loan\n* Eventually you pay it back and get your crypto back\n\nBut I have a bunch of questions:\n\n**How much can you actually borrow?** Like if I have $8k in Bitcoin, can I borrow $4k? Or is it less because of some ratio thing?\n\n**What happens if Bitcoin price drops?** This is the part that worries me. If BTC crashes while I have a loan out, do they just take my Bitcoin? How does that work exactly?\n\n**What are the interest rates like?** Is it comparable to a personal loan from a bank or way higher?\n\n**Which platforms actually do this?** I've heard of Nexo and maybe YouHodler? Are there others? Are they safe or is this risky business?\n\n**Is this actually better than just selling?** I keep thinking maybe I'm overcomplicating this and should just sell $4k of Bitcoin, pay the taxes, and be done with it.

So far Gold has been on a killing spree depsite being dead for more than 40years in term of big price jumps. One thing I noticed but it's not mentioned by anyone is that every time gold goes up in price all the BTC and crypto goes down and then vice versa. Which probably mean (for all the people asking when BTC price will go crazy) the most likely outcome is - When gold starts to cool down and drops significantly from its ATH. Then those billions will flow in other assets like for example BTC and crypto market. One thing is for sure and that is nothing is certain but this makes sense when you see the big picture. Also remember that the power of BTC is in decentralisation and not solely the price. If you expect to become rich with BTC better not buy at all and that's because you don't understand what it stands for.

Bitcoin has a tradition: Asia often sells almost any setups, while Europe frequently acts as a source of liquidity-driven bids.

Also separately noted is DVOL’s behavior starting from 00:00 NY yesterday.\n\nOn 4h (DVOL vs BTC) the current DVOL level is clearly seen in a broader context. Historically, this range often acted as a local low for volatility and frequently preceded further spikes in IV, especially during sell-off phases. At the same time, it is worth noting that a strong and sustained break and close below this level in the past was accompanied by an ATH update.\n\nSo, we can conclude that although the situation, as always, remains ambiguous, nevertheless we are indeed trading near key levels both for Bitcoin and for DVOL.\n\nSpecial attention deserves tomorrow’s expiration, for which the trading day will likely be adjusted.

But this sideways price action isn't a sign of weakness—it’s a byproduct of market mechanics.\nFor most of December, we’ve been trapped in a \"Gamma Pin.\" There is a massive concentration of options sitting right at our current price levels. This forces market makers (dealers) to hedge their positions constantly:\n• As we dip toward $85k: Dealers have to buy to stay neutral.\n• As we push toward $90k: Dealers have to sell to stay neutral.\nThis creates an artificial ceiling and floor. It’s not that traders lack conviction; it’s that the \"Big Money\" is forced to keep the price in a box to manage their own risk. This is why we feel \"stuck\" even while gold and equities are hitting new highs.\nThat pressure is about to vanish. Roughly $27 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire this week, wiping out over 50% of the total open interest in the market. Once that \"gamma pressure\" decays, the invisible walls at $85k and $90k disappear.\nHistorically, when this kind of artificial suppression ends during low volatility, the price snaps toward the direction of the heaviest positioning. Right now, positioning is heavily skewed toward Calls with strikes sitting significantly higher than current levels.\nThe range wasn’t distribution—it was containment.

I run Monaco CPA, where I focus on crypto tax.\n\nI got into this by helping friends and family figure out their crypto situations. Then friends of friends. Then strangers on the internet. The questions kept getting harder, so I kept going deeper.\n\nWhen I'm not buried in transaction histories, I'm usually losing golf balls or hunting for the best donuts in the US. Always open to recommendations.\n\nThis isn't advice for your specific situation-just how I think about Bitcoin and taxes. The basics, the long-term stuff, and some angles that don't come up much.\n\n**What Matters Now**\n\nHolding Bitcoin isn't taxable. But actually using it—spending it, swapping it for another crypto, or using it as collateral in DeFi—usually is. The IRS treats crypto as property, so any time you dispose of it, you're triggering a potential gain or loss.\n\nIf you receive BTC from mining, work, staking, or rewards, it's generally taxable when you have \"dominion and control\"—basically, when you can actually sell or transfer it. The value at that moment becomes your cost basis going forward. This comes from Rev. Rul. 2023-14.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: if your staking rewards are locked with a mandatory unbonding period, you might be able to argue that income recognition is deferred until the tokens are actually accessible. Fair warning though—the IRS hasn't issued specific guidance on this, so it's a defensible position but not settled law. Could be challenged.\n\nOn holding periods: under a year gets taxed as ordinary income (up to 37% federal). Over a year gets the long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income.\n\n**2026 Long-Term Capital Gains Brackets (from Rev. Proc. 2025-32):**\n\n|Rate|Single|Married Filing Jointly|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0%|Up to $49,450|Up to $98,900|\n|15%|$49,451 – $545,500|$98,901 – $613,700|\n|20%|Over $545,500|Over $613,700|\n\nIf you're a high earner, don't forget the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax kicks in above $200K (single) or $250K (married). Those thresholds aren't indexed for inflation, by the way—they're set in stone under IRC 1411. So the effective top federal rate on investment income is really 23.8%.\n\n**The New Recordkeeping Situation**\n\nThis is a big deal that not enough people are talking about.\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, the IRS killed \"universal pooling\" for cost basis. Under the final regs (T.D. 10000) and Rev. Proc. 2024-28, you now have to track basis per-wallet or per-account. You can't sell Bitcoin on Coinbase and use a purchase you made on Kraken to determine your basis anymore.\n\nWhat happens if you transfer BTC to an exchange without providing your acquisition info? The broker might report your basis as \"unknown\" or just leave it blank. That puts 100% of the burden on you to prove what you actually paid. Some bigger custodians are starting to issue voluntary transfer statements, but most retail users aren't getting that.\n\n**Form 1099-DA timeline:**\n\n* 2025: Brokers report gross proceeds only (basis is optional)\n* 2026 and beyond: Basis reporting becomes mandatory for \"covered\" assets (stuff acquired after 2025)\n\nBottom line: we've moved from \"report what you want and hope for the best\" to \"prove your basis or potentially pay tax on the full amount.\"\n\n**The \"basis orphan\" problem.** A lot of early Bitcoin holders bought on multiple exchanges, moved everything to cold storage, and kept terrible records. If you're in that boat, transferring those old coins to a new exchange without documentation could mean the exchange reports zero or unknown basis. That's a problem. If this is you, start consolidating and documenting now. Chain forensics, old CSVs, bank statements—whatever you can dig up will help.\n\n**Where Things Get More Interesting**\n\n**Never selling—literally.** Some people plan to hold their Bitcoin until they die. Sounds morbid, but there's real logic here.\n\nWhen you die, your heirs get a stepped-up basis under IRC Section 1014. So if you bought BTC at $10K and it's worth $500K when you pass, your heirs inherit it at $500K. They can sell immediately and owe nothing.\n\n|Scenario|Original Basis|Value at Death|Sale Price|Taxable Gain|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|You sell during life|$10,000|—|$500,000|$490,000|\n|Heirs sell after inheritance|$10,000|$500,000|$500,000|$0|\n\nOne thing to watch: Congress has proposed eliminating stepped-up basis multiple times. It hasn't passed, but the legislative risk is real.\n\n**Borrowing against it instead of selling.** Some folks take out loans using their Bitcoin as collateral. You get cash, no taxable event—because borrowing isn't income.\n\nBut there are real risks:\n\n* If BTC drops and you get liquidated, that's a taxable sale at the worst possible time\n* Counterparty risk is real (ask anyone who used Celsius or BlockFi)\n* Interest eats into your returns\n\n**Retirement accounts.** This is one of the most powerful tools that people underuse.\n\nYou can hold Bitcoin inside a Roth IRA or Solo 401(k) through a self-directed custodian:\n\n* **Roth IRA:** You pay tax on contributions, but growth and withdrawals are tax-free forever. Bitcoin 100x inside a Roth? Zero capital gains tax. Ever.\n* **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions might be deductible, growth is tax-deferred, withdrawals get taxed as ordinary income.\n* **Solo 401(k):** If you're self-employed, the contribution limits are way higher.\n* **Brokerage windows:** Some employer 401(k) plans let you access a brokerage window where you can buy Bitcoin ETFs inside the tax-advantaged wrapper.\n\n**2026 Contribution Limits (per IRS Notice 2025-67):**\n\n|Plan Type|Standard Limit|Catch-Up (50-59, 64+)|Super Catch-Up (60-63)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|401(k) / Solo 401(k)|$24,500|$8,000|$11,250|\n|Traditional / Roth IRA|$7,500|$1,100 (now indexed)|N/A|\n|Total Solo 401(k)|$72,000|$80,000|$83,250|\n\n**SECURE 2.0 wrinkle:** If your W-2 wages were over $145K last year (or $150K for 2026), your catch-up contributions have to go into a Roth. The transition period technically ended 12/31/2025, but final regs delay enforcement to 2027 for most plans.\n\nHere's a different way to think about it: yes, you lose the immediate deduction. But if you believe Bitcoin is going to grow significantly, paying tax now for tax-free growth later might actually be the better deal.\n\n**QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock).** Some investors who've made big gains on Bitcoin redeploy into qualifying startups.\n\nUnder the OBBBA (for stock acquired after July 4, 2025):\n\n|Feature|Before|After|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Holding for 100% exclusion|5+ years|5+ years|\n|Tiered exclusions|None|50% at 3 years, 75% at 4 years|\n|Per-issuer cap|$10M|$15M (indexed after 2027)|\n|Gross asset limit|$50M|$75M (indexed after 2027)|\n\nImportant: these new rules only apply to stock acquired after July 4, 2025. Old QSBS is still under the old rules.\n\nThe strategy some people use: sell Bitcoin, invest in qualifying QSBS, hold 3+ years, exit with 50%+ of gains excluded, then roll into new QSBS under Section 1045. It's a way to create compounding tax-free growth that's not available with direct Bitcoin holdings.\n\n**Opportunity Zones.** If you have capital gains from selling Bitcoin, you can defer (and partially reduce) them by putting the proceeds into a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund within 180 days. Hold for 10+ years and the appreciation on the OZ investment is tax-free.\n\nNot simple though—you need an actual qualifying fund and a long time horizon.\n\n**State residency.** Don't forget state taxes.\n\n* **No income tax on wages/investments:** Texas, Florida, Wyoming, Nevada\n* **Washington:** No wage tax, but they do have a capital gains excise tax now—7% up to $1M, 9.9% above that. So it's not \"no tax\" for Bitcoin gains.\n* **High tax states:** California (13.3%), New York, New Jersey\n\nSome people with big unrealized gains move to a no-tax state before selling. But you have to actually move—domicile matters, not just a mailing address. California and New York audit aggressively using \"closer connection\" tests.\n\n**Charitable giving.** If you donate appreciated Bitcoin directly to a charity:\n\n* You get a deduction for the full fair market value\n* You pay zero capital gains tax on the appreciation\n\nThis works best with long-held BTC that's way up. Selling first and donating cash triggers the gain—don't do that.\n\nDonor Advised Funds are useful here. Contribute the Bitcoin, get the deduction now, recommend grants to charities over time.\n\nCharitable Lead Trusts are underused, especially in high-income years. The charity gets paid first for a set term, remainder goes to you or your heirs. If structured right, you get a big deduction now to offset a Bitcoin gain, then pay tax on trust income later. It's a tax-smoothing play.\n\n**Gifting.** A few things to know:\n\n* Annual exclusion: $19,000 per recipient (no gift tax return required)\n* Lifetime exemption: $13.99M individual / $27.98M married for 2025; jumps to $15M / $30M in 2026 under OBBBA\n* Recipient takes your cost basis\n\nThe OBBBA made the higher exemption permanent—no more sunset that would've dropped it back to \\~$7M.\n\n**\"Valuation trough\" gifting:** Bitcoin's volatility is actually useful here. Gift during a market dip and you \"freeze\" the value at a lower point, using less of your lifetime exemption. All the recovery happens outside your estate.\n\n**Puerto Rico (Act 60).** This is the most aggressive move. Relocate to PR, become a bona fide resident, and new capital gains after your move can be taxed at 0%.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Actually live there (183+ days/year)\n* Buy real property within 2 years\n* $10,000+ annual charitable donation (doubled from $5K under old Act 22)\n\nThe trap: there's a 10-year lookback rule under IRC 937(b). If you had built-in gains before you moved, selling within 10 years means those pre-move gains are still U.S.-sourced. Only gains that accrue after you establish residency get the 0% rate.\n\nThe IRS is not messing around here. They launched a task force in 2021, and they've already gotten criminal convictions. In U.S. v. Gajwani (June 2025), a guy pleaded guilty to backdating an S-corp election to hide $30M in gains. He got $15.3M in restitution and a year of probation.\n\nHere's the thing: investors who want Puerto Rico to avoid taxes on frequent trading are usually the worst fit for the strategy. It works best for people who hold long-term and trade rarely. Unless you're willing to sit on your positions for a decade after moving, it probably doesn't help if you already have big gains.\n\n**The Wash Sale Situation**\n\nCurrent law as of December 2025:\n\n* **Spot Bitcoin:** Classified as \"property\"—not subject to wash sale rules\n* **Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, BITO):** Securities—subject to wash sale rules\n\nThis creates an opportunity. You can sell a Bitcoin ETF at a loss, immediately buy spot BTC, and keep your exposure. Since they're different legal categories, the \"substantially identical\" rule doesn't apply.\n\nCaveats:\n\n* The IRS hasn't specifically ruled on cross-asset \"identicality\"\n* \"Substantially identical\" is a facts-and-circumstances test\n* Treasury has proposed extending wash sales to crypto, but Congress hasn't acted\n* This is a reasonable position but not bulletproof\n\nAdvanced version: hold both spot and ETFs. When you rebalance, harvest losses from whichever is down, then immediately buy the other to maintain exposure.\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\nBitcoin tax strategy isn't about \"avoiding taxes.\" It's about:\n\n* Knowing when tax is triggered\n* Deciding where your Bitcoin exposure lives (taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts)\n* Keeping your options open as laws change\n\n**What's different now:**\n\n|Category|Old Way|New Reality|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Broker reporting|Self-reported CSVs|Mandatory 1099-DA|\n|Cost basis|Universal pooling|Per-wallet only|\n|Gift exclusion|$18,000 (2024)|$19,000 (2025/2026)|\n|Solo 401(k) cap|\\~$69,000|$72,000 (2026)|\n|Catch-up rules|All pre-tax OK|High earners must use Roth|\n|QSBS exclusion|5-year minimum|Tiered (50% at 3 years)|\n|Wash sales|Proposed for crypto|No (spot) / Yes (ETFs)|\n\nThe new documentation requirements favor institutions. Custodial services will provide clean basis reporting. Individuals managing multiple wallets face serious reconciliation headaches. The regulatory direction is subtly pushing retail investors toward custodial solutions and away from self-custody.\n\nThe main risk now isn't under-reporting—it's documentation failure. If you can't prove your basis, you could pay tax on 100% of the proceeds.\n\nThe real edge isn't the trade. It's the structure you build around how you hold your assets.\n\n**Questions Worth Asking Yourself**\n\n* What's my actual time horizon with Bitcoin?\n* Am I optimizing for now or for decades from now?\n* Do I have retirement accounts I'm not using efficiently?\n* What state do I live in, and does it matter for my situation?\n* What would it look like if I never sold?\n\nHappy to discuss any of this at a high level. Can't give specific advice in the comments, but I'm always down to talk through concepts.\n\nAnd seriously—donut recommendations welcome.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pti4cb/bitcoin_and_taxes_whats_important_now_what_could/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Metrics like wallet activity, exchange inflows/outflows, and HODLer behavior suggest accumulation is accelerating. For example, the number of addresses holding 1 BTC or more continues to grow steadily, while exchange reserves are declining, indicating that long-term holders are increasingly moving coins off exchanges and out of circulation. At the same time, entities like miners are showing disciplined selling patterns, which historically reduces short-term supply shock risk.\n\nHash rate trends also remain robust, signaling continued network security and miner confidence despite price fluctuations. Combined with growing adoption of Lightning Network channels and Layer-2 activity, these metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s network is becoming both more secure and more liquid for peer-to-peer transfers. The overall picture shows **demand building from both retail and institutional actors while on-chain supply tightens**, which has historically correlated with upward price pressure over the medium to long term.\n\nI’m curious what others are seeing in the data: which on-chain indicators do you prioritize when assessing Bitcoin’s health and accumulation trends, and are there any signals that suggest we might be entering another HODLer-led phase?", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1psfhth/bitcoins_role_in_the_current_economic_landscape/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

For shts &amp; giggles. If Bitcoin runs 30% a year. So i ask Grok. And this what happened. \nWhat Michael Saylor talking about when he say bitcoin going up 30% a year. And how many years is that? If so how much 1 bitcoin will be?\n\nMichael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin advocate, made this statement during a keynote speech at Abu Dhabi Finance Week on December 9, 2025. He was discussing Bitcoin's role as a superior store of value and treasury asset for corporations and nations, countering critics who argue it lacks cash flows by emphasizing how it can generate returns through appreciation and strategic holding. In the speech, he directly said: \"I think Bitcoin is going to go up about 30% a year for the next 20 years.\"\n\nThis is a 20-year projection, taking Bitcoin's value from today out to roughly 2045.\n\nBased on Bitcoin's closing price of about $86,932 on December 17, 2025, a consistent 30% annual compounded growth over 20 years would put 1 BTC at approximately $16.5 million by the end of that period. (This is a straightforward compound growth calculation: Future Value = Present Value × (1 + 0.30)^20. Of course, this is a prediction, not a guarantee—markets are volatile, and past performance doesn't predict the future.)\n\nSo what will 0.1 bitcoin be?\n\nIf Michael Saylor's projection of Bitcoin appreciating at **30% per year** (compounded annually) over the next **20 years** holds true, then:\n\n- 1 BTC would be worth approximately **$16.5 million** in 2045 (as previously calculated, starting from around $87,000 today).\n\n- Therefore, **0.1 BTC** (which is 1/10th of a Bitcoin) would be worth approximately **$1.65 million** in 2045.\n\n### Quick math breakdown:\nThe future value formula is:  \nFuture Value = Present Value × (1 + growth rate)^years  \n\nFor 1 BTC: ~$87,000 × (1.30)^20 ≈ $16,521,395  \n\nFor 0.1 BTC: $16,521,395 × 0.1 = **$1,652,140** (roughly $1.65 million)\n\nAgain, this is purely based on Saylor's speculative 20-year forecast—Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and no one can guarantee future returns. Past performance isn't indicative of future results!\n\nHow much will milk and eggs be?\n\nIf Michael Saylor's **30% annual compounded appreciation** for Bitcoin over the next **20 years** comes true (leading to ~$16.5 million per BTC in 2045), the key question for everyday items like **milk** and **eggs** is: in what terms are we measuring their price?\n\n### Current prices (December 2025, US averages):\n- A **gallon of milk**: around **$4.00–$4.50** (conventional whole milk; organic is higher, often $8–$9).\n- A **dozen large Grade A eggs**: around **$2.00–$3.50** (recent drops after earlier avian flu spikes pushed them much higher).\n\n### In fiat dollars (USD) in 2045:\nAssuming typical long-term US inflation of **~2–3% per year** (current market expectations and projections hover around 2%), prices would rise modestly:\n- Milk: roughly **$6–$10** per gallon.\n- Eggs: roughly **$3–$6** per dozen.\n\n(These are broad estimates—actual prices depend on supply chains, energy costs, regulations, etc.)\n\n### In Bitcoin terms (satoshis or BTC) in 2045:\nThis is where Saylor's bullish vision shines for BTC holders. Bitcoin is designed as a **deflationary asset** (fixed supply of 21 million coins). If its value rises dramatically while fiat inflates (even mildly), goods and services become **much cheaper when priced in Bitcoin**.\n\nUsing the same math:\n- Today's ~$4.20 gallon of milk costs about **~4,800 satoshis** (at BTC ~$87,000).\n- In 2045, at $16.5M per BTC, that same gallon (assuming ~$7 in inflated USD) would cost only **~42 satoshis**—over **100x cheaper** in BTC terms.\n- Eggs would drop from ~3,000–4,000 sats today to **~30–50 sats** per dozen.\n\nIn a \"hyperbitcoinization\" scenario (widespread BTC adoption as Saylor envisions), everyday groceries like milk and eggs would feel **incredibly affordable** to Bitcoin holders—potentially cheaper than they've ever been in sound money terms, thanks to productivity gains and Bitcoin's appreciating purchasing power.\n\nOf course, this is highly speculative. Bitcoin's growth isn't guaranteed, and adoption timelines are uncertain. But in Saylor's projected world, holding BTC makes basics like milk and eggs **way cheaper** over time.\n\n16.5 million in 2045 will feel like what 1 million ?\n\nIn Michael Saylor's hypothetical 2045 scenario (with 1 BTC at ~**$16.5 million**), the question of what that amount of money \"feels like\" in terms of purchasing power boils down to adjusting for expected **USD inflation** over the next 20 years.\n\n### Long-term US inflation context\n- The Federal Reserve targets ~2% annual inflation.\n- Historical long-term average (since 1913) is around 3.1%, but recent decades and current market expectations are closer to **2–2.5%**.\n- Market-based forecasts (e.g., Cleveland Fed models, breakeven rates) suggest around **2.5%** average over long horizons like 20–30 years.\n\n### Purchasing power calculation\nUsing a conservative **2.5%** annual inflation rate (compounded):\n\n- Prices in 2045 will be about **1.64 times** higher than today.\n- Therefore, **$16.5 million in 2045 dollars** would have the same purchasing power as roughly **$10 million** in today's (2025) dollars.\n\n(Quick math: Future value factor = (1 + 0.025)^20 ≈ 1.64  \nPresent equivalent = $16,521,395 / 1.64 ≈ **$10.07 million** today.)\n\n### Range of estimates\nIf we use different rates:\n- At **2%** inflation (Fed target): ~**$11.1 million** today.\n- At **3%** (closer to historical average): ~**$9.1 million** today.\n\nSo, in a realistic scenario, **$16.5 million in 2045** would feel like **$9–11 million** in current money—truly life-changing wealth, enough for multiple luxury homes, private jets, or generational financial security.\n\n### Tie-back to everyday items\nAs we discussed earlier with milk (~$4/gallon today) and eggs (~$2–3/dozen today, after recent drops):\n- In 2045 fiat dollars, they'd cost maybe $6–7 for milk and $4–5 for eggs (at 2.5% inflation).\n- But to a Bitcoin holder with that appreciated wealth, they'd still feel trivially cheap—like pennies today.\n\nThis is the core of Saylor's argument: Bitcoin's projected appreciation could massively outpace fiat inflation, dramatically increasing your real-world buying power over time. Of course, it's a bold forecast—actual outcomes depend on adoption, regulation, and macro factors.\n\nU.S. national averages as of late 2025, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and USDA reports.\n\nSo… how many sats for a dozen eggs in 2045? 🥚😏\"\nor\n\"Still think holding fiat is smart? 🤔\"", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pp0bdo/i_was_just_got_finish_listening_to_mike_talks_for/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

I’m looking for perspective from others in their mid-20s who have most of their net worth in Bitcoin.\n\nI’m 25 and turning 26 next year. I’ve been investing heavily in Bitcoin since I was 20 while working a well-paying corporate 9–5. At this point, roughly \\~**75% of my net worth is in BTC**, about **20% in 401k / IRA**, and the rest is in **cash for emergencies / liquidity** (even though I don’t love holding fiat… but we still live in a fiat world).\n\nI fully believe in Bitcoin long-term and plan to keep stacking regardless of price.

But right now, in my 20s, it feels more like I’m hoarding something incredibly valuable without a clear plan for translating it into a life.\n\nI’m NOT bearish, not doubting Bitcoin — just trying to hear how others with similar exposure are thinking about the future. **What’s your plan?**\n\nWould really appreciate hearing different perspectives even if you aren't in your mid 20s and if you're older what would you tell your younger self.

So I have a couple of thoughts about this.  First it says if you are in profit of said bitcoin that you are paying your taxes in, you don't have to pay capital gains. So theoretically, lets say you have an LLC and pay your taxes at tax time April of the following year.  You could DCA each week into bitcoin rather than setting aside cash for taxes, and although you could be in the hole, you could also be up depending on the increase in bitcoins price that year.  But here's where I see it getting interesting, if the government is going to keep said bitcoin as a part of their treasury and never sell, then effectively they are printing to \"buy\" bitcoin.  Because that tax \"revenue\" collected in BTC wont go to fund anything, and the government will essentially have to print to make up the difference in the budget.

That alone raises several questions.\n\nFirst: how does someone with such an extraordinary understanding of cryptography, incentives, and attack surfaces make such a basic operational-security mistake? Letting an email account go inactive for years while it contains historically sensitive communication is an enormous risk. Forgetfulness seems unlikely at that level.\n\nSecond: why GMX in the first place? Even by the standards of the late 2000s, GMX was not known for strong security or privacy guarantees. Choosing one of the weakest mainstream email providers feels inconsistent with the mindset that designed Bitcoin.\n\nThird: why didn’t this become a much bigger issue from a law-enforcement or intelligence standpoint? If anyone could theoretically identify Satoshi, it would be the email provider — via login records, IP addresses, timestamps, or metadata. Why was GMX never forced, publicly or quietly, to hand over everything they had? Or were they?\n\nFourth: how was it possible to run BitcoinTalk, register domains, and host infrastructure without the registrar or hosting provider being able to tie this back to a real identity? Either the OPSEC was near-perfect in some areas — or imperfect in others, which again feels contradictory.\n\nAnd finally, the coins. Roughly 1.1 million BTC (give or take) have never moved. Why? This isn’t about price — Bitcoin’s fundamentals wouldn’t change — but from a market-psychology perspective, Satoshi could trigger massive panic among weak hands at any time. The fact that this never happened is, in itself, one of the strongest signals we have.\n\nNone of this is meant to undermine Bitcoin. Quite the opposite. I’m genuinely curious how people here reconcile these inconsistencies. Are we overestimating Satoshi’s OPSEC? Or underestimating how much was intentionally left behind?\n\nWould love to hear thoughtful takes — not myths or hero worship, but grounded explanations.", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 12, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pn3vfj/revisiting_satoshi_nakamoto_opsec_gmx_and_the/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Every ten minutes the system randomly selects one winning field on a grid of unimaginable size. Players use real electricity and buy specialized machines to guess as many fields as fast as possible. The first player to hit the winning field gets points written into a public scoreboard.\n\n\n\nCrucially, every winning guess is sealed with an enormous amount of computational work. This makes it practically impossible to go back and rewrite past scoreboard entries without redoing all the work from that point forward, faster than the rest of the network combined. This costly proof is marketed as the game’s killer feature: the scoreboard is now “immutable” and “ultra-secure.” No one can steal or erase your points without spending insane amounts of energy.\n\nJohn hits the winning field and gets 1 point written into the scoreboard. Alice runs five times as much hardware and gets 5 points. The points are simply the result of who expended more energy.\n\nNow Steve comes along and pays 100 000 dollars to have John’s point transferred to him on the scoreboard while John’s score is reset to zero.\n\nQuestion: did Steve invest? Did John and Alice create tokens, money, or assets? No, it is absurd to even ask.\n\nThis is exactly how Bitcoin works. Instead of guessing fields, players (incorrectly called miners) try to guess the hash number that the network has set as the target. The first to guess it gets point (BTC) written into the public scoreboard (the blockchain). Every new block is sealed with the same enormous computational proof that makes rewriting history astronomically expensive. This proof is marketed as Bitcoin’s main value proposition: your points are “seizure-resistant digital property.”\n\nBut here is the crucial point: this has nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy. Let us explain why.\n\nInvesting presupposes the existence of a resource that generates a return.\n\nWith stocks, there is a company with economic activity. The number 100 is not points but a measure of the size of your share in that company. The return in the form of dividends, buybacks, or liquidation proceeds comes from that resource. A higher number means you are entitled to a higher return.\n\nThe dollar is a more complex type of investment where the resource is debt. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of thin air. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and machines and produces, for example, a car. You buy the car and pay in dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives those dollars, it simply deletes them from its balance sheet and they disappear. You received a car, and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished. The return in the form of the car came from the company that owed the bank.\n\nAnother example: you pay taxes to the state in dollars. The state uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are deleted from the Fed’s balance sheet and disappear from the market. You received a service (your tax obligation was erased and you are not going to jail). That return again came from the debtor, this time the state.\n\nSo the numbers in the above cases quantify the share in resources (company and debt) that generate returns. Bitcoin is not issued as a share in a company or as someone’s debt, so there is no resource generating a return for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin is literally issued only as a point in a guessing game, and the only thing being secured by all the expensive proof is the point table itself.\n\nThese points are also not tokens, money, or assets, because all such things involve some obligation, physical substance, or digital content.\n\nA token represents an obligation of the issuer: 100 on a casino chip or gift card means the issuer owes money or goods, and a larger number means a larger obligation. With physical substances such as grain, metal, or oil, and with digital ones such as MP3s, videos, e-books, or apps, a larger number means you hold more mass, more volume, or more digital content.\n\nIf John has 100 BTC and Alice has 1 BTC, that does not mean the issuer owes John a hundred times more money or goods. It does not mean John holds a hundred times more physical material or digital files. It only means he has a larger number on the scoreboard. Just as there is no resource to invest in, there’s no substance to be a token, money, or an asset.\n\nThe expensive proof does not change anything fundamental: the only thing being secured is the scoreboard itself, and the only reason miners keep producing that proof is that the points on the scoreboard still command a price. When that price collapses far enough, miners turn off their machines, the security collapses with it, and the ultra-secure points instantly become trivially rewriteable points again.\n\nIt is funny (and a little sad) how many people do not realize that Bitcoin is just a giant, energy-intensive, self-referential guessing game in which participants bet that someone will keep paying to maintain the illusion that meaningless points are valuable because they are “secure,” and they are “secure” only as long as people keep paying for them.\n\nThe whole thing remains technological nonsense and has literally nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pkm4zg/bitcoin_as_technological_nonsense_a_pointless/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

If 2026 ends up being an up year, that would directly contradict the model.\n\nSo what would actually break the cycle?\n• Losing long-term support for an extended period\n• No meaningful new highs within a reasonable post-halving window\n• Long-term holders selling into weakness\n• 2026 behaving like an expansion year instead of a reset\n\nWhat would keep it alive?\n• Holding long-term structure\n• Another ATH that holds, not just a brief spike\n• A clear post-peak cooldown in 2026\n\nNone of this proves the cycle is dead yet, but between timing, structure, and behavior, it does feel like the 4-year model is being tested in a real way.\n\nHonestly, even reading my own bullet points makes me scratch my head. That this is what it takes to either confirm or disproved the cycle. It seems to me that it has clearly been changed, but the dagger in the heart will be 2026 being an expansion green year.", "lang": null, "likes": 37, "replies": 78, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pkdqnx/is_the_4year_bitcoin_cycle_already_breaking_down/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

I'm a college student currently and I do have BTC. I'm not someone who has that much money to spend, but I do have some, and this is not a way to antagonize. It's a clear headed way of looking at it, hopefully.\n\nBitcoin is a bet on demand and adoption, isn't it? It's what I think. Do it irresponsibly and you might even call it a gamble. Its true, as money it's bad (at its current state, I think you all know why). As a hedge against inflation? It's been here for 16 years with no concise way of knowing it'll stay or keep its performance. Intrinsically, its backed by speculators (my opinion).\n\nIt's a bet that enough people believe it'll go up, that is, more people will also believe it as a way to increase their money. If enough people believe it for long enough, it may get a little bit of a normative position in society's view of finance. But that's only \"if\". If enough believe in it, it might stay valuable. \"If\". Eventually with increased marketcap, it'll be harder to make money there and then it'd be like, well, an alternative to gold, really. Or, the cycle could become the norm and it'd be an asset where people gamble for periods of times.\n\nBitcoin is a gambled speculative allocation based on long term belief adoption. And your allocation probably should be how comfortable you are with that, 1-5% probably (Consider enough exposure if it succeeds, while not enough pain if it fails). It's a bet on adoption and demand, some people want that bet, some don't. Bitcoin is not guaranteed, not inevitable, not backed by fundamentals, not a proven hedge, not money today. Again, it's a bet on adoption and demand (some people want that bet, some don't.)\n\nThank you and do engage if you say there's an aspect missed so that others consider it.\n\nI made a recent post in the most bearish sub for bitcoin (you know which sub), and they should have pointers to consider on why bitcoin adoption and demand making it into a financial norm in some way or niche has difficulties.\n\nedit: typo", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pk97xg/a_view_on_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}
