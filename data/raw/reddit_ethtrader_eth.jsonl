Lately I’ve been spending more time on Rainbow, and yeah, the ETH-only thing keeps getting in my way. I actually like how clean and smooth the app feels, but the moment I need to do anything on Bitcoin or Solana, it turns into a hassle. Suddenly I’m opening two or three other wallets just to move stuff around or check balances, which kind of defeats the point of having a “main” wallet.\n\nI get why Rainbow does it. Focusing on Ethereum makes the UX way better and less cluttered, and if you’re deep into DeFi or NFTs on ETH, it’s honestly great. But if you touch other chains even a little, it starts to feel limiting. Simple things like moving funds or tracking everything in one place become more annoying than they should be.\n\nRight now I’m stuck in this half-and-half setup. Rainbow for ETH, then another wallet for Solana, another for Bitcoin. It works, but it feels messy and easy to lose track of stuff. I’ve been seriously thinking about switching to a multi-chain wallet and just keeping ETH there too, even if the UX isn’t as nice.\n\nAt the same time, part of me likes having a dedicated ETH wallet that just does one thing really well. Curious how other people handle this. Do you intentionally stay ETH-only and accept the trade-offs, or do you run a multi-chain wallet as your main and deal with the extra complexity?

A recent Bankless tweet discussed the recent increase in companies that are accumulating ETH as part of their treasury. Vitalik Buterin shared his view of the situation: he supports the idea of ETH treasuries, however he is not blindly bullish on it. According to Vitalik having companies hold ETH as part of their treasury allows more users to gain access to it, without having to use a wallet, exchange or DeFi protocol. As a result this will create more economic alignment across the ecosystem and also a path to wider adoption. And of course the more options are available for holding ETH, the stronger the network will be.\n\nAt the same time Vitalik shared an important note: it is not ETH treasuries themselves that are a threat, it is the leverage potential. Vitalik warned that if ETH treasuries transition to leveraging things could turn bad very quickly. In situations where companies begin borrowing against their ETH holdings and the price drops, the pressure to liquidate positions could lead to a cascade of forced liquidations. We witnessed scenarios like this play out time and time again and they never end well.\n\nWe should not ignore this possibility. For reference publicly traded companies like BitMine were reported to hold almost 4 million ETH which represents 3% of the total ETH supply. This level of influence and risk becomes too real once debt is added into the equation, so the conclusion is pretty easy to draw. Having more access to ETH is a good thing but turning ETH into a house of cards is not. An increase in long-term holders will make Ethereum less fragile.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/Bankless/status/2004587304636359056*", "lang": null, "likes": 26, "replies": 28, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pyj2su/vitalik_supports_eth_treasuries_but_warns_about/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

That means almost two thirds of the money locked in DeFi is still on Ethereum and the trend is important here. This share grew again during 2024-2025. Back in 2022, Ethereum's dominance dropped to around 45% and a lot of people thought that was the beginning of the end.\n\nSince then, Ethereum has slowly but steadily recovered its position. If you also count Ethereum Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, etc, Ethereum's real share of DeFi goes above 70%. Pretty clear that most DeFi activity still lives inside the Ethereum ecosystem even if it is not always on mainnet.\n\nThis tell us a few things, money is not leaving Ethereum, big capital still prefers Ethereum because it is secure, liquid and prove. Furthermore, more institutions keep choosing Ethereum again and again and this is serious because they hate losing money. Also Layer 2s are not replacing Ethereum, they are strengthening it by making it cheaper and more scalable.\n\nIn other words Ethereum keeps evolving and its the ecosystem everyone its choosing to work with.  \n\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2004659275159708094](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2004659275159708094)", "lang": null, "likes": 20, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pwrl14/2025_review_ethereum_still_dominates_defi_with_64/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

From a structural perspective, a move below recent local lows would not be unusual. ETH has historically shown a tendency to trade through visible support levels and trendlines in order to clear resting liquidity before any sustained continuation. These types of moves are often misread as breakdowns when, in reality, they can simply be part of the market’s process.\n\n  \nWhat stands out more than direction at the moment is compression. Volatility has remained relatively muted for an extended period, and when ETH enters this kind of environment, expansion typically follows. Whether that expansion begins with a downside sweep or a reclaim of current levels is still uncertain, which is why I’m avoiding strong directional bias for now and letting structure guide expectations rather than predictions.\n\n  \nIn the meantime, I’ve been focusing on staying engaged with onchain activity without forcing trades. Personally, that has meant participating in routine Onchain execution while the market continues to develop. As part of that process, I’ve taken part in Bitget current Onchain challenge, not as a trading signal or recommendation, but simply as a structured way to remain active during a slower, more indecisive market phase.\n\n  \nOne observation from that experience is that BGB functions primarily as a utility token tied to platform usage rather than short-term narrative trading. Gaining exposure through participation and activity feels fundamentally different from speculative positioning, especially for those thinking in longer time horizons.  \nFor now, ETH remains a market where patience, liquidity awareness, and structural context matter more than conviction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1shbp8ufm9g1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd030f4b77b8d9063a6a9d50e130d637f588e65d", "lang": null, "likes": 10, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pwgf0h/eth_market_structure_and_liquidity_considerations/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

On Twitter Obol Collective talked about Ethereum reaching its full maturity, no longer existing as just another crypto in an endless loop of trends, bubbles and booms. Obol identifies 10 significant developments this year which were indicated by key events. These events also indicate that Ethereum has grown up.\n\nAt the start of the year many people believed that Ethereum was being left behind by Solana and that the Ethereum community was running out of patience. However that changed when the Ethereum Foundation shifted into what Obol calls 'wartime mode.' The new leadership, a different set of priorities and a great deal of effort toward scaling and improving the overall Ethereum user experience suggests that Ethereum was very much awake the whole time.\n\nEthereum made significant upgrades since it went 'wartime mode':\n\n* Pectra made staking more efficient.\n* Institutions stacked ETH and made it a yield-bearing asset.\n* Stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets kept choosing Ethereum, even as new L1's tried to compete.\n* L2's scaled activity without breaking the base layer, proving that a lot of FUD was wrong.\n* Then there is reliability. 10 years, 0 downtime.\n\nAll of this is way more valuable than hype will ever be. In 2025 Ethereum proved everyone that it can evolve without losing what made it trustworthy initially.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/Obol_Collective/status/2003487361766686790*", "lang": null, "likes": 33, "replies": 35, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pvzzwy/2025_was_a_turning_point_for_ethereum/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

The only thing investors can reasonably do is draw on historical data and past market cycles, while assessing forward-looking fundamentals such as tokenisation, stablecoins, and broader blockchain adoption.\n\nHistorically, Ethereum’s price has been heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors, including wars, political instability, pandemics such as COVID-19, tariffs, and periods of heightened uncertainty. Another significant driver is retail participation and media attention. In 2025, a large share of retail and media focus shifted toward AI, which likely diverted capital away from crypto and into AI-related equities and narratives.\n\nLooking at the data, certain years stand out as particularly weak for Ethereum, notably 2018, 2022, and, so far, 2025. This raises the question of whether Ethereum could extend this pattern of underperformance into 2026. \n\nWhile my personal opinion is ultimately irrelevant, I remain cautiously optimistic that the early months of the year, particularly January and February, could see more constructive price action because of the following reason. There are several potential catalysts that could support the crypto market, including progress on U.S. crypto market structure legislation in January, the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts as inflation eases and new FED chairman. Also, at the beginning of the year, retail usually invests when there is liquidity.\n\nAny thoughts?", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pvbdk2/eth_monthly_return_performance/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

A user called Sam (sam6170) on Twitter, in a post summed up something a lot of Ethereum users never thought they would say: a 'complex' transaction on mainnet now costs only a few cents.\n\nFor a long time using Ethereum meant paying expensive gas fees. Bridging could easily cost $20 or more, that limited average users and turned simple on-chain actions into expensive decisions. If you were not there it is hard to explain how bad it was. This is why Fusaka is huge, it changed how gas works on mainnet. The network optimized block gas limits and transaction caps so now it can process more activity without fees exploding. Now transactions that used to hurt feel normal xD.\n\nThe way that Sam reacted in his tweet shows the big change in Ethereum user experience. You do not need to plan your day around gas anymore, you do not need to wait for low-traffic hours, you just use the network... whenever.\n\nData after the upgrade shows the rollout went smoothly, we had no downtime and just a few minor early bugs. This is how trust is built and trust brings users back. Lower fees are a nice upgrade and they are the difference between Ethereum being a tool designed for technical users and a network normal people can actually use. This is on-chain adoption.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/sam6170/status/2002889906134339699*", "lang": null, "likes": 91, "replies": 54, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ptrrg1/ethereum_is_finally_usable_again/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

That says a lot about what comes next. According to a recent tweet posted by data analyst 'CW', on-chain data shows that ETH whales are doing something worth paying attention to. They are buying more ETH.. even though their profits dropped to 0.\n\nThe important detail here is the realized price of accumulation addresses. This metric tracks the average cost of ETH that is held by long-term whales. Recently ETH touched that realized price again and again, around $2,900. In simple terms whales are holding at breakeven. Normally this is where we would expect selling. No profit, a lot of uncertainty, easy exit.. but that is not what is happening.\n\nIn the tweet CW points out that inflows to accumulation addresses have actually increased. These wallets are not moving ETH, they are stacking. That means something because whales tend to act early. Whales do not buy aggressively if they expect a long bear market. Right now this current scenario gives whales room to keep buying without chasing pumps.\n\nThis does not guarantee an immediate pump however it does give us some bullish sentiment. When whales buy at breakeven instead of selling they are getting ready for higher prices in the future. If price holds well then this accumulation phase looks like quiet confidence.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/CW8900/status/2002416391274766419*", "lang": null, "likes": 102, "replies": 61, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1psxooh/eth_whales_are_buying_at_breakeven_that_says_a/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

In a recent tweet posted by Garrett ('GarrettBullish') recently, he suggested that ETH could be on the verge of a huge turning point in its comparative performance against the Nasdaq 100. The focus of his tweet is on the ETH/Nasdaq ratio which is the ratio of how ETH has performed against tech stocks vs the dollar.\n\nThis indicator has been tested several times since 2021 and each time it reached the low of around 0.11, ETH had been oversold with its RSI being near 30. And after that.. ETH bounced back. Yesterday ETH closed at $2,827 and the Nasdaq 100 was around 25,147, which put the ratio right back at 0.112 near where it reached in the past before other reversals happened.\n\nIn Garrett's opinion ETH and the Nasdaq are closely related and therefore, there is not much of a gap between the two for long-term. When one falls behind and then catches up to the other, that should happen again and again. The ratio going back to 0.16-0.22 would mean ETH would outperform stocks by a lot when compared to the Nasdaq.\n\nThere is a political side to this as well. The SEC Chairman Paul Atkins showed publicly his approval of tokenization and on-chain settlement of all stocks. Therefore if equities in the U.S. gradually transition to being settled on Ethereum then it means there will be a lot of demand for it.\n\nFor those of you who hold ETH, we can conclude that historical data shows that having patience is the best strategy.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/GarrettBullish/status/2001892822459572520*", "lang": null, "likes": 43, "replies": 26, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pred3f/eth_vs_nasdaq_and_why_eth_looks_ready_to_catch_up/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

That is not early, that is basically not even on the chart. This tell us a few important things that tend to get lost in Crypto Twitter hype cycles.\n\nEuro stablecoins are still macro irrelevant, even after recent growth, they are effectively invisible compared to the size of the euro monetary system. Furthermore, adoption is massively behind USD stablecoins. Dollars found product market fit on chain years ago. Trading pairs, DeFi collateral, remittances, RWAs, treasuries, etc. Euro rails, still searching for their use case.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is doing the heavy lifting. Most euro stablecoin liquidity and activity lives on Ethereum today. Other chain exist but liquidity is fragmented, thin and often ecosystem \"isolated\".\n\nThis leads to the real issue, there is no dominant euro stablecoin rail. No clear winner.\n\nThis is not a tech problem, it is a regulatory, cultural and institutional problem. European finance moves slower, prioritizes compliance first and lacks the same dollar centric global demand loop. But this will change for sure in the future and if tokenized assets, on chain funds and European RWAs scale in the next years, euro stablecoins wont stay at 0.006% forever and they will become relevant. Ethereum is poised to handle most of it for sure.\n\nEUR stablecoins are still in pre-infrastructure era.\n\nWhen do you think this adoption will happen?\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001838903796404522](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001838903796404522)", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pr9rwd/eur_stablecoins_are_still_just_0006_of_eur_m2_and/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

In the meantime stocks are doing well and gold keeps hitting new records.\n\nYou probably would have done better keeping cash under your mattress xD. So what happened?? Ethereum advocate sassal.eth thinks he knows. In a reply to a frustrated investor's tweet, he blamed crypto's biggest influencers. According to sassal the most influential people in the space normalized scams and grifts instead of exposing or calling them out. Anyone who tried to warn people got called an idiot or ignored. And now everyone is paying the price. The entire market is suffering because trust got destroyed from the inside. Even projects with real revenue and billions locked are bleeding out.\n\nMemecoins are worthless right when they launch and NFT's (generally speaking) are completely dead. There is a lot of retail frustration, many people cannot recommend crypto to friends anymore without feeling like they are doing harm. Sassal's point is when big influencers promote sketchy projects for profit, you cannot act surprised when regulators crack down and investors run away.

(Speculation on the Dec 19 Catalyst) (Disclaimer: I’m not a financial professional or a lawyer. I utilized AI tools to assist in parsing the dense regulatory framework and market plumbing. Treat this as speculation/theory based on my interpretation of public data. I am long BMNR.)\n\n1. The Data Doesn't Add Up (The 0.71 Signal)\nSkeptics keep telling me BMNR is just a \"meme stock\" and the short interest is manageable (~7%). But I’ve been staring at the tape and the math simply isn't adding up.\n• The Vault: BMNR locks up ~3.9 million ETH (3.2% of global supply).  \n• The Tape: FINRA reports ~27M shares sold short.\n• The Anomaly: The \"Days to Cover\" ratio is 0.71.\nWhy this is weird:\nA 0.71 ratio means the entire short position turns over in less than one trading session.\n• The Standard View: \"It's just high liquidity.\"\n• My Hypothesis: For a holding company that acts as a vault, this turnover is incredibly high. It raises the question: Is this volume real, or is it algorithmic churn masking a lack of genuine shares?\n\n2. The \"Shadow Float\" Theory (The Mechanism)\nThis is where it gets interesting. I’ve been digging into how \"locates\" (the requirement to find shares before shorting) work, specifically regarding tokenized assets and DeFi rails alongside the recent SEC \"Sandbox\" news.\n\nThe Loophole Theory:\nWe know that under Reg SHO Rule 203(b)(1), a broker needs \"Reasonable Grounds\" to locate a share.\n\n***IF funds are using \"wrapped\" or tokenized versions of the stock to satisfy these locate requirements...\n***AND if those tokens are being re-hypothecated (lent out multiple times) in DeFi liquidity pools...\n***THEN one physical share could theoretically generate multiple \"valid\" locates.\n\nThe \"Napkin Math\" on the Dark Float:\nIf this mechanism is active, the reported Short Interest is meaningless because the fails wouldn't show up on standard reports—they'd likely end up in the NSCC Obligation Warehouse (ex-clearing).\n- If we assume a standard DeFi leverage multiplier (3x) on the reported short interest...\n- Estimated Shadow Liability: ~81 Million Shares.\nAgain, I do not have access to the internal ledgers to prove this, but this \"Shadow Float\" theory is the only thing that explains the 0.71 turnover ratio to me.\n\n3. The Catalyst: The \"Tokyo Pivot\" (Tomorrow)\nRegardless of how the positions are structured, the funding for these positions is about to get expensive. A huge chunk of global risk-taking is funded by the Yen Carry Trade (borrowing cheap Yen to buy/short US assets).\n• Consensus: The Bank of Japan is projected to hike rates to 0.75% tomorrow (Dec 19).  \n• The Risk: If the Yen strengthens, the cost of maintaining leveraged arbitrage positions spikes.\n\nIf my theory about the \"Shadow Float\" is correct, a rate hike isn't just a macro event…it could act as a margin call on the cheap money that sustains this liquidity.\n\nI’m not guaranteeing a squeeze. However, the options flow today (0.50 Put/Call ratio) suggests that Smart Money is bracing for a move.\nIf the BOJ turns off the \"free money\" tap tomorrow, and if that \"Shadow Float\" exists, the liquidity mirage could evaporate very quickly.\n\nSummary: The official data might not tell the whole story. Watch the BOJ decision tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR: I’ve been analyzing the settlement flows for BMNR and I believe there are structural risks that the market is overlooking. With the Bank of Japan (BOJ) projected to hike rates tomorrow (Dec 19), I think we could see a significant volatility event. Here is my working theory on why the liquidity might be thinner than it looks.\n\nPositions: Long BMNR.

Well, this is not another \"just use L2s\" narrative (although L2s are still crucial). Scaling is now happening on the settlement layer itself. That is the layer that actually carries Ethereum's economic weight. Finality, security and value settlement.\n\nMore L1 capacity is equivalent to cheaper and more available blockspace for high value activity like DeFi liquidations, large trades, institutional flows, etc.\n\nL2s are amazing at scaling execution but they depend on a strong L1. When L1 throughput increases, the entire rollup ecosystem benefits. Fees stabilize, congestion eases and Ethereum's role as the coordination and settlement hub gets stronger.\n\nIt is very important to have this always in mind:\n\n* L2s scale how much can be done\n* L1 scaling strengthens why Ethereum is the place to do it\n\nExecution can fragment but settlement can't.\n\nEthereum is not trying to win a TPS arms race. It is optimizing for economic gravity and base layer scaling is a massive part of that story.  \n\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001249793180307579](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001249793180307579)", "lang": null, "likes": 29, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ppkhs5/ethereum_l1_is_scaling_again_and_this_time_it/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

More gas per block means more transactions and smart contract stuff can fit into each block, which can improve throughput and could ease fee pressure if the network is congested.\n\nChristine Kim from Galaxy Digital shared notes from the All Core Developers call where Nethermind folks sounded confident about moving toward a 75M–80M gas limit after Jan 7. But there are still two client level optimizations that need to land first, so this isn’t a “done deal” yet.\n\nAlso small correction on the timeline: 2025 had three gas limit bumps. early Feb went 30M to 35M, July went to 45M, late Nov went to 60M. If 80M happens in January, that would be the first increase of 2026, not the fourth of 2025.\n\nThe Jan 7 BPO fork is also expected to raise blob capacity by another \\~66% (separate from gas limit but related to scaling). Blobs are basically extra data space mainly used by rollups.\n\nDevs meet again on Jan 5 to confirm plans, so nothing is locked yet.

Helped my friend purchase a home using Ethereum!\n\n1.      They did not want to convert Ethereum to Cash for the purchase to avoid the additional taxes from trading, that felt like a waste of money right off the bat, so it was important to purchase using the Ethereum directly.\n\n2.      We transferred the Ethereum to an escrow service instead of directly to the seller of the house to ensure security of the funds until all terms of the sale were completed. Yes, it took a while to find an escrow service that accepts cryptocurrency in general. Escrow service was also used due to cryptocurrency price volatility, with a clause we agreed upon with the seller that we’ll work together on large price changes. Our agreement was, a decrease of 10% or greater we would value the cryptocurrency at 5% less than the current value we had written in the contract. Similarly for an increase of 10% or greater, we would value the cryptocurrency at 5% more than the value we agreed upon in the contract. Also, the escrow service fees and transaction fees were split 50% between the buyer and seller.\n\n3.      We also had to find a seller that will accept Ethereum which limited our options, but WE DID IT! So some sites like Zillow allow listing your home for sale for cryptocurrency, but whether they did or not, we asked all the sellers of the homes if they would consider a sale in cryptocurrency.\n\n4.      No, we did not use NFTs, just Ethereum. We were talking about creating a NFT for the sale for years, but it just didn’t feel worth the time when it came time to move forward with buying the home. It would’ve just been a cool keepsake for my friend, but not a real digital asset of a title or anything haha. We are still talking about how NFT titles would be awesome if it was more accessible and streamlined in the future.\n\n5.      No, they did not need a loan, so that simplified this process since we didn’t have to wait for confirmation from the mortgage lender etc, it was just between us and the seller and escrow service.\n\nIt was scary seeing so much Ethereum being moved in person. I only see posts about large amounts being moved, but we got sweaty seeing it in real life. Yes, we definitely did a test transaction and quadruple checked the wallet addresses!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask, will try my best to answer all the questions!\n\nEdit 1: lots of comments asking about Capital Gains tax. They didn't plan on paying taxes. Went through mixer and paid from fresh wallet, no Kyc. Will update post if they end up paying taxes later on.

The more we see what happens when projects launch, it becomes more clear that the future of crypto belongs to Ethereum L2's. We have seen this year a lot of alt L1's launch with 'great' plans and then we have witnessed them all go away very quickly. The majority were not being used frequently enough, also they did not have much revenue. None of them would have been able to afford to keep their validators online had they not minted more and more coins.\n\nNow we see that even the 'best' alt L1's are failing miserably. Solana is another example of this problem. Solana has to continue increasing its hardware requirements to keep its speed. This increases the bar to entry for smaller validators and decreases decentralization.. which is one of crypto's principles. Almost all of these chains cannot stay viable financially without continuous inflation. This cannot continue to go on and will not be sustainable long-term.\n\nL2 chains do not suffer from these problems, they inherit Ethereum's security instead of having to try to build a security system from the ground up. L2's have a scalability model that does not increase the amount of centralization over time. And also they do not need to keep printing a massive number of tokens to stay relevant or viable.\n\nLiquidity, on-chain activity and user adoption are now heading towards L2's.

Over recent months, **ETH’s realised volatility** has remained in the **55–60% annualised range**, compared with **35–40% for Bitcoin**, around **15% for the Nasdaq**, and roughly **10% for the S&amp;P 500**. This gap is not cyclical noise. It reflects Ethereum’s structural position as an asset that concentrates uncertainty rather than diluting it.\n\nImplied volatility reinforces this view. **ETH-DVOL (30-day)** has consistently traded between **65% and 80%**, remaining above realised volatility. The market continues to pay a premium for future uncertainty. Risk is not dismissed; it is explicitly priced.\n\nUnlike equity markets, where volatility is often anticipated without being fully experienced, Ethereum internalises risk. There is no external insurer, no stabilising narrative. ETH does not attempt to appear safe. It forces participants to confront trade-offs directly: between decentralisation and scalability, security and efficiency, monetary restraint and usability.\n\nAs Vitalik Buterin succinctly observed:\n\n&gt;\n\nThose trade-offs are clearly visible in the fundamentals. Approximately **30 million ETH** are currently staked, representing close to **25% of total supply**. This reduces liquid float while amplifying sensitivity to flows and sentiment. Since the introduction of **EIP-1559**, fee burn has periodically exceeded gross issuance, producing episodes of net supply contraction — but without delivering stability. Supply is constrained, not predictable.\n\nAt the same time, **Layer-2 networks** now process multiple times the transaction volume of Layer-1. This improves scalability and lowers costs, yet introduces a new layer of uncertainty around value capture and long-term fee dynamics. Ethereum increasingly resembles an economic system in motion rather than a finished product.\n\nThis combination explains why ETH remains structurally volatile even in calm market conditions. Volatility here is not a sign of dysfunction. It is the price of exposure to an evolving system.\n\nThis past week showed no signs of panic.  \nNor did it signal a return to comfort.\n\nEthereum continues to trade precisely where **potential return begins at the point comfort ends**.", "lang": null, "likes": 45, "replies": 36, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pm7wdm/ethereum_is_not_a_comfortable_asset_the_numbers/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

ETH spent most of this year at a lower price than normal, we can confirm this by looking at monthly data. According to a tweet by Milk Road, ETH logged 8 red months so far this year. In the entire history of ETH only 1 year ended with more red months than that. This is something very important, let's understand why.\n\nWhen an asset dips month after month the selling usually stops being about sentiment, normally it is funds reducing exposure. In other words people who need cash and cannot afford the risk anymore. What happens then is forced selling takes over. According to Milk Road, a lot of that pressure happened in November. Volume went up but price stopped falling at the same pace, usually that is what exhaustion looks like, so sellers are still here but they are running out of bags to sell.\n\nETH is trading in a different environment now, a lot of the investors who needed to sell already did. Treasuries accumulated ETH, weak hands are gone and over-leveraged degens are also gone. Therefore all that is left is a market with fewer people forced to hit the sell button. This does not mean that price goes up tomorrow but it does change things. Since most forced sellers are gone it takes less new demand to pump the price and when sentiment finally changes, there is less resistance on the way up. The bottom may finally be in.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/MilkRoad/status/1999509638493217022*", "lang": null, "likes": 84, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pliqib/eth_has_fewer_forced_sellers_left_after_months_of/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

I stopped trading options to track this \"Liquidity Mirage\" instead. (Target: $6k) I’ve never posted here or anywhere on Reddit really, usually just lurking, but I wanted to share this because the broader market narrative seems completely disconnected from the actual data I'm seeing. I’m a freelance analyst, but I didn't start digging into this for work. I did it because I was frustrated.\n\nBack in October, I was trading near-expiration options on BMNR. It was a daily grind, I was glued to the charts, watching every tick, trying to play the technicals. I wasn't blowing up my account, but I wasn't exactly crushing it either. The ROI on my time was terrible because nothing was respecting the usual setups. The moves didn't match the signals. It felt like the game had changed and nobody sent out the patch notes.\n\nSo I took a step back. I stopped the active trading and started just... counting. For the last month, I’ve been tracking the BMNR ETH Treasury strategy and the broader Ethereum liquidity flows for about 6 hours a day. \n\nThat’s when I saw it. The macro and micro picture has created this weird \"Goldilocks\" scenario that most short-term traders (like my former self) are completely missing because they're looking at lines on a chart instead of the plumbing. \n\nHere is what I found:\n\n1. The \"Bathtub\" Effect (Where did the coins go?) The first thing that stood out was the volume capacity. I track \"Liquid Supply\"—basically coins that are actually sitting on exchanges ready to be bought or sold, not stuck in deep cold storage.\n*** Back in August: ~20.5 Million ETH ***\n*** Right Now: ~16.4 Million ETH ***\n(ETH Exchange Reserve Data via CryptoQuant)\n\nThat is roughly 4.1 million ETH (20% of the float) that just isn't there anymore. It didn't vanish, it just moved to places where it doesn't move:\n\n*** Staking: Fed cuts rates -&gt; Defi yields look way better -&gt; People lock their coins.\n*** The ETF \"Hotel California\": Retail buys the ETF ticker, but the actual ETH gets sent to Coinbase or Fidelity cold storage. It leaves the float.\n*** The Macro Shift: We went from the Fed pulling money out in August (QT) to the Fed pouring money in now (QE + Rate Cuts).\n\n2. The \"Disbelief\" Signal\nThis is the part that convinced me we're early.\nThe CFTC Pilot is a bigger deal than people realize. Institutions can NOW pledge ETH as margin. This is huge! Instead of selling ETH to raise cash, they lock it up to trade other stuff. It basically turns ETH into a high-quality collateral asset. \n\nBut look at the funding rates…In August, funding was positive (everyone was long and leveraged to the gills). Right now? Funding is negative.\nShorts are paying longs to hold positions. This is a classic \"disbelief\" rally. The market expects a crash, so they are fading the move. If we break $3,200, those shorts are forced buyers in a market with 20% less supply.\n\n3. The Retail Distraction\nHonestly, I think the reason this hasn't ripped yet is because everyone is distracted by SOL and XRP. Retail is chasing \"utility\" and payment narratives, which is fine, but they are missing the institutional squeeze happening on ETH. Retail is looking left, institutions are taking the supply from the right. \n\nThe Math (The \"Liquidity Mirage\"):\nI ran some models using the Square Root Law of Market Impact (sounds nerdy, but it just measures how much price moves for every dollar of inflow). Because the order books are so much thinner now, money hits way harder. In July/August, $1B of inflows moved the cap about $20B. Now? That same $1B moves the cap ~$30B. The liquidity on the screen is a mirage. It looks normal, but the depth isn't there.\n\nMy Take:\nBased on the liquidity-adjusted multiplier, I'm looking at $6,000 by mid-Jan as a conservative target. If we get a supply shock event, $7,500+ isn't out of the question. The only way this breaks is if the regulatory stuff around the CFTC pilot gets killed, which would send us back to $3,500.\n\nAnyway, stop trading the ghosts of August. The mechanics are different now.\n(Obviously not financial advice, just sharing what I've been staring at for a month.)\n\nTL;DR: I quit trading chopped-up options last month because the charts weren't making sense. I spent the last 30 days tracking liquidity flows, macro/micro events, news, and used Gemini Ultra to help me understand my observations. The data is clear: 20% of the supply has vanished since August, and new collateral rules just lit a fuse.

Combustion Chamber — Execution &amp; State Transitions\n\nThis is where thrust is born.\nExecution clients translate compressed input into validated state changes — akin to atomising fuel and igniting it with mathematical certainty.\n\t•\tGas utilisation is your fuel flow.\n\t•\tExecution latency mirrors flame stability.\n\t•\tReorg risk is the analogue of combustion instability — rare, but monitored with the same seriousness as a pilot watching for a flameout oscillation.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Exhaust &amp; Finality — The Engine’s Signature\n\nThe exhaust stream defines the engine’s net thrust.\nFor Ethereum, this is finality: the moment blocks become effectively unchangeable and the aircraft commits to its trajectory.\n\nCurrent state:\n\t•\tSlot finality remains strong and predictable.\n\t•\tEconomic security (staked ETH) acts as the engine’s titanium shell.\n\t•\tBlock times are steady, showing a healthy and well-trimmed powerplant.\n\n⸻\n\nPilot’s Closing Note\n\nViewed through an aviator’s lens, Ethereum resembles a next-generation turbofan running at high efficiency: formidable compression through rollups, stable burn in the execution core, and a clean exhaust signature through robust finality.\nIn short: the aircraft is flying well, with thrust to spare.", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pj3121/etherum_a_pilots_briefing_on_a_quantumage/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

According to Milk Road on Twitter, ETH ETF's just saw their biggest single-month outflow ever with approximately $1.4 billion in net outflows. This is the largest withdrawal from an ETH ETF since the launch of ETF's. It may look like a terrible metric on the surface but it is important to understand that the overall significance of this metric is a lot less problematic.\n\nThese days ETF flows reflect the amount of demand for an asset. As a lot of investors sell their shares it usually means that risk appetites are dropping. When interest rates go up or stocks dip, as well as any fears about macroeconomics, these events impact negatively ETF flows instead of impacting the fundamentals of the asset itself. Therefore ETH did not 'break' during this time, instead liquidity just declined dramatically.\n\nThe interesting part of this is that as the ETF outflows were happening, we began seeing an inflow of treasury purchases. Milk Road reported that institutions were buying, for example Bitmine added close to 300k ETH during this same period. Once again while retail was panicking and withdrawing funds, institutions were taking advantage of this fear.\n\nETF outflows remove liquidity from the market and create volatility in the short-term, however the increasing treasury inflows will limit future supply and will create a much more robust environment soon, maybe next year. People keep focusing on the bad side of the chart, the smarter thing to do is paying attention to the buyers who stacked quietly while everyone was selling.\n\n[ETH ETF flows turn negative by year-end.

On Twitter, Jrag.eth posted something that is worth reading. Low ETH exchange balances used to be a bullish indicator for ETH holders but that is no longer the case. 6 years ago when ETH left exchanges the typical reason behind it was that the user was holding ETH in anticipation of a future price pump. At the time CEX's were the only place to sell ETH for fiat or other coins so there was an actual supply squeeze.\n\nToday however, things changed drastically for ETH with a lot of the action taking place on-chain through:\n\n* Staking\n* Restaking\n* L2's\n* Collaterals\n* DeFi\n* Etc\n\nTherefore the majority of the people who hold ETH today do it by parking their ETH in one of these methods. And if they want to sell there is no need to send their ETH to a CEX, instead most people simply swap their ETH for a stablecoin without ever having to deal with a CEX. Until now we can see that while there remains selling pressure, the selling pressure is no longer visible using older metrics where CEX's reported their balance on a daily basis.\n\nEven though exchange balances are now reporting to be at their ATL in 10 years and some headlines are calling it a 'tight supply' environment, these factors alone do not necessarily mean that we should expect a huge pump for ETH. This change in market structure means that metrics previously used to determine supply and demand for ETH are now outdated. So if the indicator is outdated why are people still following it blindly??\n\n*Source: https://x.com/Jrag0x/status/1997774217069138203*", "lang": null, "likes": 30, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pi5dde/why_low_eth_exchange_balances_do_not_mean_what/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Anyone attempting to navigate this landscape without acknowledging these deeper currents is, quite simply, mistaking noise for signal.\n\nThe first and most conspicuous feature is the decay of authentic order book depth. The liquidity displayed on major venues is a polite fiction; true resting interest retreats the moment aggression intensifies. The refill ratio, that discreet but indispensable indicator of genuine depth, has weakened markedly. In such an environment, even modest waves of aggressive flow are sufficient to displace price by nearly a full percentage point — the origin of the familiar ±1–2% intraday oscillations.\n\nSecondly, the behaviour of gas fees deserves particular attention. When block costs settle into their current moderate regime, arbitrage engines temper their hyperactivity, liquidation patterns acquire civility, and the entire flow structure becomes almost ceremonial in its rhythm. The result is not a directional impulse but a form of disciplined volatility, wherein micro-retracements frequently complete with mathematical neatness.\n\nThirdly, one must note the gentle indecision of the funding curve. Perpetual funding oscillates about neutrality with a decorum that precludes both exuberant squeezes and dramatic unwinds. It is, unmistakably, a liquidity-led market rather than one steered by conviction.\n\nA Practical Illustration\n\nIn such a regime, the refined practitioner would naturally gravitate toward short-cycle mean-reversion constructs rather than grand directional wagers. One might, for instance, observe ETH dipping into a liquidity pocket around –1.2% from session VWAP, coupled with a temporary widening in the bid–ask spread and a visible thinning of the first three levels of the book.\n\nAt this juncture, a measured long entry with tight risk (0.4–0.6%) and a disciplined take-profit near the mid (0.8–1.1%) becomes intellectually justifiable — not as speculation, but as an exploitation of microstructural regularities.\n\nConversely, should ETH over-extend +1.5% above VWAP on tepid funding and a declining refill ratio, a light counter-trend short, again with modest leverage and narrower targets, would be the proportionate response.\nThese are not trades of bravado; they are trades of literacy.\n\nFinal Remark\n\nUntil depth, refill efficiency, gas behaviour or funding undergo a profound shift, the market will continue to reward not the loudest actors, but the most technically fluent.", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1phwe87/ethereums_microstructure_on_the_subtleties_that/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

According to a tweet posted by rostyk.eth, Solana's validator count has decreased a lot falling to below 800 from over 1,900 (2022). This data created some concerns about the future of Solana as a L1 chain. Rostyk.eth thinks that Solana's only real option is to become a rollup on Ethereum, because Solana is spending billions of dollars every year to keep validators running and at the same time, the network is becoming more and more centralized due to the shrinking number of validators and also increasing hardware requirements to become a validator.\n\nThe situation of Solana's validator count has not been simply bad luck, rostyk.eth thinks this is the result of the design decisions that were made when Solana was created. The design choices of the network to scale its validators rely on heavy hardware, this results in less validators and therefore a less decentralized network. To 'fix' this Solana created more SOL to try to keep validators online. The problem is this inflation contributes to the devaluation of SOL and the absence of slashing or security features means the network is forced to continue spending increasing amounts of money to maintain a smaller number of validators. As I have mentioned in previous posts: in the long-term keeping most chains as L1's is not profitable.\n\nRostyk.eth believes that Ethereum L2's were able to grow past Solana because they do not rely on the same level of consensus mechanisms, therefore Solana cannot compete with Ethereum Mainnet in throughput, since increasing throughput requires more hardware requirements.\n\nRostyk.eth's message is that if you are a Solana believer then the safest long-term strategy is to make Solana an Ethereum rollup.\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/rostyketh/status/1997647730118680901\n* https://x.com/KEMOS4BE/status/1997448647198290154", "lang": null, "likes": 49, "replies": 57, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1phdfht/some_say_solanas_future_depends_on_becoming_an/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

The Base Fee oscillating around 0.4 gwei situates the system in what can only be described as a state of serene idleness. This is as close as Ethereum comes to a quiet country estate on a Sunday afternoon: no congestion, no haste, no quarrel for blockspace.\n\nAcross the 25-block sample, utilisation remains strikingly subdued. Many blocks are scarcely filled; only one approaches full capacity. Under the logic of EIP-1559, such behaviour naturally guides the Base Fee gently downward, with the occasional single block nudging it upward again—never aggressively, always within the algorithm’s graceful limits.\n\nIn practical terms, this environment implies three things.\n\nFirst, transactional urgency is entirely absent. The network will include transactions promptly without the slightest incentive. Tips, though available, are largely ceremonial.\n\nSecond, the burn mechanism is effectively dormant. At these vanishingly small fee levels, Ethereum’s deflationary engine contributes only the faintest whisper to supply dynamics. One might say the system is burning incense rather than fuel.\n\nThird, the activity that does persist is mechanical rather than purposeful—dominated by low-margin MEV strategies and automated arbitrage, the quiet clockwork of a market waiting for a reason to awaken.\n\nFrom a market-structure perspective, such calm is rarely decisive. It neither precedes euphoria nor heralds distress; it simply reflects a network untroubled by meaningful flow. ETH’s recent ±2–3% oscillations are entirely consistent with this: movements driven by liquidity conditions rather than fundamental impetus.\n\nWith the network presently operating at an unhurried Base Fee near 0.4 gwei, it is appropriate to consider how such tranquillity might shape Ethereum’s economic profile in the coming days and weeks.\n\n1. The Burn Outlook: A Period of Near-Neutral Monetary Drift\n\nAt current conditions, Ethereum’s celebrated burn mechanism contributes only marginally to supply reduction.\nTo put it plainly: the network is not burning enough ETH to exert any material deflationary pressure.\n\nIf such levels were to persist for an entire month, the effect on supply would be scarcely noticeable. Ethereum remains structurally capable of turning deflationary—but today, it prefers a gentle stroll to a march.\n\nHistorically, even modest increases in transactional intensity—DeFi’s leveraged summer, the NFT manias, periods of elevated liquidations—have lifted Base Fee fifty- to hundred-fold. Under those regimes, burn becomes a market force in its own right. Today’s levels are orders of magnitude below that threshold.\n\n2. Market Microstructure: A Network Awaiting a Catalyst\n\nLow gas often coincides with price ranges such as the one you observed (ETH oscillating within ±2–3%).\nThe absence of on-chain urgency renders Ethereum oddly buoyant yet directionless.\n\nA tightening of volatility, a shift in macro liquidity, or a renewal of on-chain speculation could unsettle this equilibrium. It takes very little—one spirited DeFi rotation, a wave of NFT minting, or a liquidation cascade—to lift gas from 0.4 gwei to 5, 15, or 30 gwei.\n\nUntil such a spark appears, the network is likely to maintain its present composure: quiet blocks, unobtrusive MEV activity, a market that drifts rather than advances.\n\n3. The Historical Contrast: A Sleeping Giant\n\nDuring periods of genuine exuberance, Ethereum resembled a metropolitan exchange at the height of the trading day—crowded, noisy, and expensive. Blocks brimmed with activity, the Base Fee soared, and ETH’s supply curve bent sharply downward.\n\nToday’s environment bears no resemblance to those episodes.\nIt is polite, orderly, and economically tame.\n\nForward Positioning\n\nIn summary:\n\t•\tBurn neutral\n\t•\tMicrostructure docile\n\t•\tVolatility contained\n\t•\tA move will come—but not from within the chain itself", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ph0u5t/ethereum_gas_conditions_a_discreet_technical/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

This is an error of scale. For two years, ETH has no longer been just another blockchain: it has become the programmable settlement infrastructure on which institutions are silently rebuilding global finance. And this change is much deeper than the price suggests.\n\nThe first disruption is tokenization. In 2024–2025, banks, managers, custodians and fintechs began to switch bonds, private credit, monetary deposits, fund shares, receivables and even structured products to an on-chain version. For what ? Because Ethereum offers something that no banking architecture has ever achieved: a single, programmable, finalized ledger, compatible with any legacy system and capable of operating 24/7. Private blockchains did not win. It is the ultra-optimized and interoperable Ethereum L2s that are absorbing growth.\n\nSecond rupture: the role of stablecoins. 80 to 90% of crypto flows are settled in stablecoins, but the key data is not capitalization. This is the usage. USDC/USDT now functions as a global currency rail, much more efficient than the international banking network. And the majority of these flows pass… on Ethereum and its L2s. The network becomes the de facto basis of the digital dollar on a global scale. This creates a gigantic network effect: the more flows move on-chain, the more the demand for Ethereum increases mechanically (security, data, settlement, finality).\n\nThird break: the modularity of the network. Ethereum no longer tries to do everything on layer 1. It specializes in the “security + finality” layer, while L2s become the new execution environments. This fractal architecture transforms Ethereum into a financial operating system, where money markets, derivatives, deposits, securities, institutional lending protocols or fully automated products can be grafted.\n\nThe 2026 narrative is therefore not “ETH will go up”.\nThe narrative is: finance is migrating to an open, neutral, programmable network — and this network is called Ethereum.\nThe prices will end up reflecting what the structure has already recorded.", "lang": null, "likes": 106, "replies": 50, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pgblgm/ethereum_2026_the_coin_that_everyone_looks_at/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Historically, the business cycle is usually 4 years long, resulting in the 4-year Bitcoin cycle. The current business cycle is slower and set to rise in 2026. Whenever it peaks and bottoms, crypto does the same with high correlation.\n\nThe business cycle bear market was due to QT during 2022-2025 and rate increases during 2022-2024. QT has now ended with rates continuing to decrease. The Fed will need a reason to implement major QE. 2026 is the year with ATH amount of government debt being paid and refinanced.

On the last blocks around #23,940,500, network usage remains around 50–52%, well below the peaks observed during the NFT or DeFi mania phases. This explains the relatively low base-fee level: 0.084 to 0.098 gwei, which mechanically reduces the cost burned per block.\n\nDespite this moderate activity, the burn continues: between 0.0023 and 0.0043 ETH per block in the samples you displayed. The majority of blocks display 100% of the 9 possible blobs, proof that the ecosystem is indeed adopting proto-danksharding (EIP-4844). This is a key point: the channel is not underutilized, it is simply more efficient.\n\nOn the production side, we clearly see the domination of MEV builders: around 86% of the blocks come from BuilderNet, QuasarBuilder, Titan, etc. This confirms that the MEV market is very integrated and absorbs the majority of the flow, which avoids extreme variations in gas priority. The validator reward remains low: often 0.012 to 0.022 ETH per block, sometimes a spike when a MEV bundle passes (eg: 0.039 ETH).\n\nIn terms of price, ETH shows a structure very consistent with what we see on-chain. Stable network usage + low base fee = reduced deflationary pressure → ETH remains dependent on the macro narrative and market liquidity rather than an internal shock. Halving churn does not create an immediate supply effect, but it slows down the arrival of new validators, which stabilizes the share of rewards and reduces marginal inflationary pressure.\n\nResult: ETH is today evolving in a technical waiting zone, in range, mainly driven by desks which arbitrate MEV and options. The market prices an environment:\n– almost neutral net supply,\n– moderate but regular burn,\n– very clean fundamentals (full blobs, low gas, stable latency).\n\nIn short: the blocks are clean, the network efficient, the supply disciplined.

On Ethereum, that means ETH.\n\nHe explains it pretty straightforwardly, if Apple shares can trade directly into Tesla shares, or USD turns directly into RMB, or fractions of real estate swap into wheat futures without a middle step, then you do not need BTC as a bridge. Everything happens atomically on one system. The asset required for every move is the native gas token.. that is ETH.\n\nJourneyMacro's idea connects to another one of his tweets about how Ethereum today is like the internet in 1996, the big players did not even exist back then.

When you zoom in on the real numbers, the picture looks a lot less multi chain revolution and a way more \"Ethereum doing all the heavy lifting\".\n\nAs the tweet states and the data above:\n\n* **$18.7B in distributed RWAs on chain** and the majority of that sits comfortably on Ethereum.\n* **32 networks being tracked** but Ethereum still dominates with an impressive difference on market share.\n* **555k+ RWA holders,** growing \\~6% in the last 30 days alone showing that adoption is accelerating.\n\nThis is basically institutional money and regulated products choosing the best project that brings them the best security, maturity, liquidity and developer trust. Ethereum has a decade of battle testing, it is where the liquidity lives and it is where other big names like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and all the TradFi giants are deploying first. Ethereum is the right choice.\n\nOther chains are also promising and will keep getting traction but Ethereum will be a leader and I love to see that L2s are also in a good position making this argument more strong.\n\nEthereum is the future.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1996183904114372943](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1996183904114372943)", "lang": null, "likes": 41, "replies": 29, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pdudhj/ethereums_dominance_in_rwas_is_ridiculous_the/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

No indicator offers a comparable level of granularity: the derived metrics (funding, OI, skew) are useful but reactive; Twitter discussions are noisy. The block reflects the operational truth of the network in real time. Here is the full reading based on the latest analyzed blocks.\n\n1. Transactional composition – an organically active network.\nCurrently, the transaction mix shows a strong dominance of swaps, bridging, L2 operations and optimized batches. This composition is very different from phases of “artificial” activity dominated by mint NFTs or spam bots. Here, we observe a functional, useful, clean network activity, which reflects a real use of L2s, DEXs and inter-layer arbitrations. When this mix remains consistent for several hours, it is almost always a sign of stabilization then expansion.\n\n2. Priority Fees – micro-tensions but absence of stress.\nPriority fees experience several micro-peaks, but all very short. This is the typical behavior of MEV arbitrations between L2. What would be worrying: a prolonged peak, an unstable plateau or erratic behavior. Nothing like that here. The network absorbs the peaks cleanly.\n\n3. Gas median – the key variable that many ignore.\nThe median gas remains below 22 gwei, which is a very healthy level for a network experiencing increased activity. This means:\n\t• no congestion,\n\t• no overload,\n\t• no forced blockspace compression.\nThis is exactly the profile of a network “under constructive pressure”. Phases where the median remains low but the blocks are full often precede bullish breakouts.\n\n4. Structural burn – the silent mechanics.\nWithout being explosive, the burn exceeds the issuance on a majority of blocks. These are small margins, but cumulatively they create positive tension. It is this micro-deflation mechanism that supports momentum even when the price seems to be hesitating.\n\nConclusion.\n\t• Clean blocks\n\t• Organic mix\n\t• Absence of stress\n\t• Burn &gt; Issuance\n→ ETH remains in a silent ascending phase as long as this structure holds 24–48 hours.\nTactical zone: 2310.\n\n⸻", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pdt7ji/eth_live_reading_of_blocks_the_complete_analysis/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Hi everyone,\n\n\n\nI’m looking for a reliable way to swap ETH to BTC and back, with a strong preference for non-custodial solutions. I want to avoid using centralized exchanges where I have to give up control of my funds, even temporarily. Ideally, I’d like to use a platform or protocol where I retain full control of my private keys throughout the entire process.\n\n\n\nPrivacy is also very important to me. I’m trying to avoid services that require intrusive KYC verification. While I understand that some platforms are required to follow these regulations, I believe there are still options out there that respect user privacy and stay true to the original values of decentralization in crypto.\n\n\n\nSo far, I’ve come across a few services like ThorChain, Uniswap (possibly via an aggregator), and atomic swap protocols. I’ve also heard of platforms like SideShift, FixedFloat, and ChangeNOW, but I’m unsure which ones are actually trustworthy, non-custodial, and privacy-friendly.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve used any of these services, or know of other good options, I’d really appreciate your input.

Merlijn The Trader posted a tweet that feels pretty obvious in hindsight. JP Morgan and BlackRock did not end up on Ethereum because of a trend or hype. They came here because Ethereum actually works. Ethereum has 10 years of uptime without a single day where the chain stopped. For institutions that move a lot of money that is the whole point.\n\nAccording to Merlijn Ethereum is slowly but surely becoming the place where the biggest financial players settle value. It is the collateral layer for institutional loans. Ethereum is the system behind their stablecoins and it is becoming the place where global liquidity runs on. These firms do not choose tech for fun, they choose what does not break.\n\nThis is very important if you care about where Ethereum is going. Institutions do not need memes, they do not need hype cycles. What they need is reliability and right now, Ethereum is the only chain that gives them that without compromise. The change is not loud, but it is steady. Every time a major bank runs something on Ethereum instead of a private chain, it tells us this is the settlement layer they trust. Ethereum is 'becoming the institutional settlement layer.'\n\n*Source: https://x.com/MerlijnTrader/status/1995553482456142260*", "lang": null, "likes": 54, "replies": 28, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pd2n3p/why_do_you_think_institutions_are_building_on/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

According to Ethereum community member and trader Ryan Berckmans, people are looking at ETH all wrong. They judge ETH's performance with ETH/USD, which gets mixed together with Bitcoin's price swings, global risk appetite and the usual crypto cycle noise. Ryan says that hides what is really happening to ETH.\n\nThe clean signal is ETH/BTC. By this measure ETH is doing far better than the headlines make it look. The ratio is up about 80% from the Q2 lows which is a huge move for a pair that usually grinds slowly. To Ryan that pump shows stronger confidence in Ethereum itself and not in the broader crypto market.\n\nSomeone in the comments on Ryan's tweet pointed out something similar, that the 'decoupling is happening' since old BTC ranges do not impact ETH the way they used to. For instance a few years ago, BTC under $100k would have meant ETH under $2k, however ETH holding above $3k right now shows the ratio has improved and that ETH is not tied to BTC the way people assume.\n\nIn other words the message here is if you judge ETH by ETH/USD then you miss the bigger picture, but if you follow the ratio you see a network stepping into its own.

Either ETH bounces back up from 3000 and we see at least a fair short term long trade opportunity with a 3500 USD target, or we see it rejects 3000 USD level with a fair short trade opportunity expecting perhaps a double bottom forming over the next 2-3 weeks.\n\n  \n**Mid term:**\n\nI think we either saw an intermediate bottom or the bottom. In any case, the two-months bearish trend will significantly slow down. Ranging between 2700-3000 would get me optimistic for Q2 2026. I think the recent bottom won't be broken down in the near future, if broken at all. \n\n  \n\n\n**There is, however, a mid-term bearish case...**\n\nToday's 3000 is March of 2025's 2000 and one more volatile wave is still coming. Long term weekly charts indicate key zone between 2300-2500. \n\n  \n**... and a counter-bullish case:**\n\nVolume on last week's bottom was the highest since mid-bull wave of August 2025. Even higher than the panic of October 10th week. I would interpret this as a lot of ETH moved from the fearful to the greedy. Volumes were not as high as the precedent drop, however, but still relatively high when compared the post-August run.  \n\n\n[Seems like a lot of positions were taken just below 2500 USD over the last 1.5 year.

I’ve been analyzing different ways to hedge my spot ETH positions during this current low-volume chop. Usually, I would open a short on GMX or dYdX to hedge downside risk, but the liquidation wicks lately have been brutal.\n\nI’ve started experimenting with on-chain \"Volatility Prediction\" instead of directional trading.\n\n**The Concept:** Instead of betting that ETH goes up or down, you bet that ETH will have the **highest percentage move** relative to other assets (like BTC or SOL) over a fixed time frame (e.g., 8 hours).\n\n* **Scenario A (Directional Short):** ETH drops 5%, but a random scam wick hits your stop loss first. You lose.\n* **Scenario B (Volatility Long):** ETH drops 5%. Since this is a bigger move than BTC (-2%), you win the volatility bracket.\n\nNew dApp on Arbitrum called **Candle Wars** that gamifies this. It uses a pari-mutuel pool (winners split the losers' pot) rather than a house edge.\n\n**The Math:**\n\n* If you hold spot ETH and the market crashes, your portfolio value drops.\n* However, volatility usually spikes during a crash.\n* If you win the \"Volatility Battle\" with a small hedge position, the payout (often 3x-5x the entry) can offset the spot loss.\n\nHas anyone else tried hedging via **volatility markets** rather than perp shorts?

The amount of ETH on spot exchanges keeps falling and yet the price does not respond at all. If supply on exchanges keeps falling and price keeps going down then something else is going on.\n\nJourneyMacro says this is not organic. He points to years of 'bear raids,' big players dumping huge stacks of ETH during thin weekend or late-night trading. This creates forced stop-losses, pushes price down fast and lets whales profit on shorts. Anyone who has watched ETH nuke on a quiet Saturday knows something is up. Of course retail sentiment is negative because this hits retail hardest, because this kills trust in ETH as a short-term store of value, even though it is irrelevant long-term.\n\nETH's role as the base asset of DeFi does not change, ETH's long-term value is not dependent on weekend liquidity games. However the short-term damage is real and it keeps regular investors nervous.\n\nIn his tweet JourneyMacro points out that Tom Lee raised an $800 million 'war chest' designed to counter these dumps, the problem is one player will not fix everything. He says the market needs more actors coming in to break these coordinated sell-offs. So in summary the data keeps pointing out the same thing: low exchange supply is not the problem, the market structure is.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/JourneyMacro/status/1993955687358251490*](https://x.com/JourneyMacro/status/1993955687358251490)", "lang": null, "likes": 65, "replies": 57, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p8pmzb/eth_price_changes_show_no_connection_to_exchange/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Recently 'Mastering Ethereum: Second Edition' was released and in a tweet f1go.eth called out a big misunderstanding about ETH: ETH is only a utility currency used to pay for gas. That description made sense.. years ago, but it does not fit Ethereum in 2025.\n\nF1go.eth gives a more precise description, ETH is turning into the reserve currency for the on-chain AI economy. It is also a store of value which already yields more than 2%, while being less inflationary than Bitcoin if you consider actual issuance and burns. Also that yield grows with adoption. And DeFi and restaking make ETH even more productive. It is also the most permissionless collateral across the biggest DeFi ecosystem. Anyone can use it, build with it or lock it into financial apps without asking for permission. This puts ETH in a different category from most assets in crypto.\n\nYes ETH still pays for blockspace but to pretend that is the whole story is to ignore everything that has happened since.

Every time ETH nukes, the tokenized asset layer steps in like a giant invisible buy wall. It does not matter if it is stablecoins, RWAs or tokenized liquidity, the growing base consistently catches the price before it goes into a free fall.\n\nYou can see the three big moments on the chart where tokenized assets bottomed out first and shortly after, ETH followed its reversal and it just happened again.\n\nThe interesting part is not just the timing, it is the trend. This tokenized base keeps getting thicker and more assets are moving on chain, stablecoin supply is rising again and RWAs are a real thing. As this base grows, ETH's downside protection becomes more solid.\n\nThe data does not lie, tokenization is real and its shaping Ethereum's market structure in real time.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1993692532245504141](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1993692532245504141)", "lang": null, "likes": 54, "replies": 14, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p7v4nn/ethereums_tokenized_asset_base_keeps_proving_its/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

You do not need to believe in chart astrology to understand why people are paying attention, gold's run happened because the market stopped fighting the trend. When buyers took over the pump lasted years!!!\n\nETH is in a similar spot now but with way stronger fundamentals: cheaper gas from higher block limits, a lot more activity on L2's, more burns and a roadmap that keeps pushing the network forward.

Yes I know the title only mentions Bitcoin and that this is an Ethereum subreddit but bear with me.\n\nDavid Hoffman co-founded Bankless and is an early Ethereum advocate. On Twitter he pushed back hard on a claim that seems never to die: 'If Bitcoin dies, all crypto dies with it.' The idea makes sense.. if you only believe in a Bitcoin-centric view of the world. You should not and Ethereum proves why. David explains that Ethereum has zero technical dependency on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin stopped producing blocks tomorrow Ethereum's stablecoins, dApps, validators, burns and trillions in settlement volume would keep moving without a problem. That is to say the ecosystem stands on its own.\n\nThe point of David Hoffman's post is to teach us about quantum security. Quantum computers threaten chains that expose public keys too early and Bitcoin is one of them. Leading researchers like Scott Aaronson warn that quantum revolution is getting closer and closer and Bitcoiners are now openly getting worried about this. David says this risk is Bitcoin's problem and not Ethereum's, this is because Ethereum hides public keys behind hashed addresses and already has a roadmap for quantum-safe signatures.\n\nIf Bitcoin ever failed because it waited too long to upgrade, David Hoffman says that Ethereum would not collapse with it. Instead Ethereum would likely take the number one spot. The network would keep on producing blocks, burning ETH and running the world's most reliable on-chain economy, exactly as designed.\n\nIf anyone wants to read David's full post I will leave the link at the end of this post, it is quite long but it is worth it!!\n\n*Source: https://x.com/TrustlessState/status/1992553642885316854?s=20*", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 41, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p69et6/bitcoin_is_not_cryptos_center_and_quantum_risk/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

I’ll explain more below.\n\n\n\nFor anyone looking to do this at size\n\nWhen you start talking seven or eight-figure allocations, the challenge isn’t executing the trade it’s moving the position somewhere that won’t trigger compliance headaches.\n\nFor context:  \nI work for a regulated Swiss financial intermediary that helps large crypto holders enter Swiss private banking, including cases where clients want to hold products like BMNR inside a private bank account, fully KYC/AML-vetted and cleanly documented.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the few jurisdictions where private banks will actually onboard large crypto-origin wealth if everything is structured correctly and that includes custodying listed crypto-exposure products.\n\nBut with the right introductions, the right narrative, and the right people presenting your file doors tend to open that normally stay firmly shut.", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p67bkx/eth_exposure_on_discount_bmnr_is_trading_below/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

My investment thesis is that ETH will increase price because of increase in its demand, however, the wide adoption of L2 are significantly reducing fees for L1 which reduces yield and the rate tokens being burned. There could be a win/lose scenario where Ethereum becomes like the internet as an infrastructure but all the money are going to AWS and the Googles of the world. It would be a win for the tech and a loss for investors. What is your value proposition for ETH?\n\nFor ETH to reach multiple level of today’s price, there has to be a significant increase in fundamental value proposition, not just buying and investor sentiment.\n\nMy investment thesis:\n1. Digital asset platform for NFT (low impact)\n2. Increase in ETH demand because of usage (stablecoin/ tokens) (high impact)\n3. Yield asset - yield has been dropping consistently (depends on the yield, ppl won’t buy it for yield if they can get better yield elsewhere)\n4. ETF for retirement (only if price has shown to go up as an asset, funds won’t touch assets that do not have good returns)\n5. company Treasury (only works if ETH price goes higher)\n\nSo in summary, the true price driver is the demand for L1 at the current state.

According to researcher Joseph Young, Ethereum is getting to a phase most people are still not paying attention to: real and long-term deflation. The path to this is based on upgrades that change how the network handles data, scales activity and burns ETH. Right now L2's like Base, Arbitrum and Lighter are posting record activity. Most of their data gets uploaded to Ethereum as blobs and every blob fee is paid in ETH and then burned. This alone already matters.. but it is about to matter a lot more!!\n\nThe next Fusaka upgrade (PeerDAS) increases blob throughput from 6 to 48. That is an 8x increase in capacity for L2's to push heavier applications like high-frequency trading or the kind of perps run by Lighter. Simply put: more blobs means more ETH burned. The problem is PeerDAS increases the load for nodes but that problem gets solved by EIP-7928. It removes the main verification bottleneck and keeps block checking fast and predictable even with all the extra data.\n\nTogether these two upgrades combined create a simple loop: more L2 activity → more data posted → more ETH burned → stronger supply pressure. The point Joseph Young makes is that every step Ethereum takes in scaling its ecosystem directly increases the value of ETH itself.\n\n[Graph taken from the tweet.](https://preview.redd.it/7u44tiheqt2g1.jpg?width=1031&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaaa594d87b42f2794b785f621e170755c2a17a)\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/iamjosephyoung/status/1991899406245790143?s=20*](https://x.com/iamjosephyoung/status/1991899406245790143?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 129, "replies": 45, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p3vj3y/ethereums_next_upgrades_set_the_stage_for_real/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

After a certain point, users with higher governance weights don't get new perks. So there's no real milestone / recognition for users who hold a larger amount of Donuts and consistently support the community.\n\nHigh GW users may feel like they're not acknowledged in r/EthTrader.\n\n---\n\n## Problem\n\nUsers with a higher GW are usually the most active and invested in r/EthTrader. And yet some of them may get the feeling that they're not getting anything new from holding or increasing their GW beyond a certain level. This makes higher GW feel stagnant.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\nI propose giving users with, at least, 500K GW the ability to customize their user flairs. This becomes a new fun milestone and a reward for staying committed long term.\n\nTo keep things simple, in an initial stage users would request their custom flair through mod mail, like this:\n\n* Mod mail title: `Customize User Flair`\n* Mod mail body: `Hello World` (this is the flair's content)\n\nNotes:\n\n* Mods would set the flair manually.\n* Users could update the flair, through mod mail, at reasonable intervals.\n* The flair would have a golden \"500K\" badge attached to it.\n\n---\n\n## Advantages\n\n* Adds a new use case for DONUT.\n* Creates a milestone at 500K governance weight.\n* Encourages long term holding and engagement.\n* Gives high contribution users a visible way to stand out.\n* Builds a better connection between governance participation and subreddit identity.\n* This is very simple to implement.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n* Before automation, more mod mail and manual flair changes, depending on demand.\n* This removes a unique perk from Special Memberships, since custom flairs would no longer be exclusive to subs.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis ETIP gives long time and high GW community members a simple reward that reflects their contribution. It strengthens the connection between governance weight and subreddit identity, adds yet another organic use case for DONUT, and improves r/EthTrader's incentive structure. This also gives more recognition to active DONUT holders.\n\n---\n\nThe choices are:\n\n* [YES]\n* [ABSTAIN]\n* [NO]\n\n*This proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days, according to the [governance rules &amp; guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance/).

And ZK-EVM stands to push Ethereum into a different league by letting anyone run a full node from a phone, I have talked about this in previous posts.\n\nOn top of this FOCIL reinforces censorship resistance and Ethereum is preparing for when quantum attacks become real. Starting in 2030 all network upgrades plan to make ETH quantum-secure. Bitcoin will not have that advantage.. especially for older coins. Ethereum's L1 is the heart of the system, it anchors DeFi, it anchors every L2 and it anchors ETH's role as a global reserve asset. This is the next phase in Ethereum's growth into the world's financial backbone!!\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1991172751302832498?s=20\n* https://bitref.com/nodes/\n* https://etherscan.io/nodetracker", "lang": null, "likes": 61, "replies": 29, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p207e0/ethereums_l1_comeback_shows_why_the_base_layer/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

SharpLink recently posted an update on Twitter that proves that the real wealth in crypto comes from patience, not trading (sentimentally). Since the company launched its Ethereum staking strategy in June 2025 it has gained a total of 7,067 ETH in cumulative rewards. Last week alone they pulled in another 492 ETH. And.. they are not selling anything, every bit stays staked and compounding into more.\n\nThis approach should serve as an example for many people, especially the noisiest people on social media. While most investors go after short-term price swings, SharpLink has begun to prove the long-term works better. ETH is one of the few assets where holding actually gives yield in the form of staking rewards that grow over time, without taking on unnecessary risks. That is what they mean by 'the best risk-adjusted way.'\n\nOne may ask why are they doing this?? The answer is simple: Ethereum keeps growing, staking keeps paying and compounding keeps on compounding. SharpLink is letting time and math work in their favor by not cashing out, but rather keeping rewards staked. There is a lesson in here for everyone, if you believe in ETH's long-term value you do not need to guess the next move. You just buy, stake, hold and let the ecosystem's growth pay you for waiting.

Decentralization has always been the metric that matters the most in crypto, and Ethereum is pulling away from everyone else. As rip.eth says in a tweet there is a big difference between Ethereum and other L1's. Solana and Bitcoin are becoming harder to participate in, while Ethereum is working to make it easier. Now Solana validators require 128GB RAM servers with 24 CPU cores, the same goes with Bitcoin miners you just cannot compete without industrial-scale ASIC farms and cheap power. That is not decentralization but centralization by cost.\n\nIn the meantime Ethereum's next big step is zkVM's: zero-knowledge virtual machines that make validation light enough for literally anyone to do. Thanks to new tech like Brevis's Pico Prism our phones or small computers can verify blocks in seconds, without requiring a ton of hardware and storage. That means anyone, anywhere, can join the network and help secure it.\n\nAs you can see Ethereum is not just keeping the lead but it is also increasing the gap, while other chains raise the barrier to entry Ethereum is lowering it. The result is a blockchain that is not just the most decentralized today but is designed to stay that way. Decentralized is also about who actually allows everyone to participate.. and Ethereum does.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/ripeth/status/1987948319398654305?s=20*", "lang": null, "likes": 56, "replies": 30, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ov4zb7/ethereum_keeps_getting_more_decentralized_while/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Ethereum is scarcer on centralized exchanges than Bitcoin.\n\nOnly around 10% of ETH's total supply is still sitting on exchanges compared to 14% for BTC. This might not sound huge at first look but in terms of market structure, it is a massive shift.\n\nFor the past two years, ETH holders have been moving their coins off exchanges and into staking, DeFi protocols and cold storage (dont tell me you hold your coins long term in a hot wallet please). Since the Merge and the rise of liquid staking platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, etc are locking Ethereum into the network itself.\n\nAt the same time Bitcoin exchange reserves has been slowly declining but not as fast as Ethereum's. This trend is shows that ETH is evolving from tradeable asset into a productive, yield bearing on chain economy.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1ou0lfi", "author": "aminok", "handle": "aminok", "created_utc": 1762836789.0, "text": "Ethereum’s Trust Layer Expands Beyond the Blockchain A new demo called **compute-escrow-privy** shows what the next stage of Ethereum’s expansion might look like. Built on **EigenCompute**, part of the EigenLayer ecosystem, it connects an ordinary Web2 escrow service to Ethereum’s validator-backed trust model.\n\nIt’s a small project, but it represents something big: the extension of Ethereum’s security into the off-chain world.\n\nThe demo uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) backend and Privy authentication, letting users sign in through standard Web2 methods while the core logic settles verifiably on Ethereum. Developers can fork the repository, deploy it through the EigenX CLI, and run a service that looks like a normal web app but operates under the same type of trust guarantees that secure the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat this shows is more than a technical trick. It is a working demonstration of a new design pattern for how trust itself can be built, reused, and extended.\n\n# 1. Practical verifiability for Web2\n\nInstead of launching new blockchains or validator networks, developers can now anchor traditional applications to Ethereum’s existing security. That makes it practical to build verifiable services — like escrows, marketplaces, or data processors — without needing to reinvent the infrastructure of decentralization from scratch.\n\n# 2. ETH as a universal bond\n\nIn this model, **ETH becomes the reusable foundation of digital trust**. The same capital that secures Ethereum’s consensus can now back independent services, functioning as a kind of economic bond for integrity. Each new application strengthens the network’s relevance, because its trust ultimately flows from Ethereum’s validators and the collateral they restake.\n\n# 3. Familiar experience, verifiable core\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, nothing changes — logins, dashboards, and APIs all feel like the Web2 internet. But under the hood, execution happens in verifiable environments, and outcomes can be proven on-chain. This merges convenience with verifiability instead of forcing a choice between them.\n\n# 4. Broader implications\n\nIf this pattern spreads, it could reshape how the internet handles trust.  \nDevelopers might stop creating new chains for every new idea and instead **reuse Ethereum’s validator base** to secure services directly. A whole market could form around *renting* Ethereum’s trust, where validators, restakers, and developers price and trade cryptographic assurance itself.\n\nIt also means that the boundary between Web2 and Web3 could fade. The same Ethereum security that once applied only to smart contracts could start underpinning AI models, databases, and cloud apps, without users even realizing it.\n\n# 5. A shift in Ethereum’s role\n\nRollups and data blobs scaled Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions. EigenLayer and applications like compute-escrow-privy scale something different: **its trust model**. Ethereum’s reach is no longer confined to blockchains — it’s becoming a **base layer for verifiable computation**.\n\nWhether this model becomes a standard is uncertain, but its direction is clear. Ethereum’s trust is beginning to extend beyond its own chain, out into the rest of the internet.\n\n**Source:** [Layr-Labs/compute-escrow-privy on GitHub](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/compute-escrow-privy)", "lang": null, "likes": 22, "replies": 19, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ou0lfi/ethereums_trust_layer_expands_beyond_the/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

So many people still consider Monero or even ZCash to be the real privacy coins. However according to CloutedMind on Twitter, that is not the case. Ethereum is not branded as a privacy project but it is actually doing more for on-chain privacy than anybody else in practice.\n\nEthereum is the only network that fought the U.S. government.. and won. When the sanctions were applied to Tornado Cash in 2022 the Ethereum community did not give up and it adapted. Developers started focusing on zero-knowledge tech, privacy layers and tools that let users stay anonymous.. while still using DeFi. That last part is very important, you can hold Monero or ZCash all day but what can you really do with it? You cannot connect it to permissionless protocols, lend, borrow or build. ETH lets you do all that and now, it is building ways to do it privately. ZK rollups, stealth addresses, private transfers, it is all happening here on the chain everyone said was 'too transparent.'\n\nPrivacy should not just be hiding your money, it should also be being able to use your assets freely, without permission or exposure.

The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.\n\nBefore Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.\n\nBeyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.\n\nBeyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nEvery operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.\n\nAcross Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.\n\nThe effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.\n\nIn parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.\n\nTogether, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.\n\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.

This is not what a \"dead\" network looks like right? This is what real adoption looks like.\n\nAs you know, gas represents how much computation is happening on the Ethereum network, every swap, NFT mint, airdrop, smart contract interaction or layer 2 bridge burns a bit of gas. Meaning that if gas usage keeps growing, activity is booming, more users, more builders and more protocols are using Ethereum chain as their foundation.\n\nThe good thing is that growth is happening even if most transactions move to L2s like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism. They are scaling on top of it too. Furthermore, validators numbers keep growing and ETH inflation/deflation is currently at +0.799 since burn which is pretty good.\n\nNow you know that Ethereum is alive that keeps building and that its the future, so not lose faith on it, price is not everything and soon it will catch up with the amazing tech.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/eth\\_everstake/status/1986783837540569463?s=20](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1986783837540569463?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 44, "replies": 37, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1orknmi/ethereum_daily_gas_usage_hits_a_new_alltime_high/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Most of the activity came from Lighter, a zero-knowledge perpetuals exchange that recently launched its mainnet.\n\nLighter processed several thousand TPS on its own, temporarily accounting for the majority of Ethereum’s overall transaction throughput. It uses ZK proofs to batch and verify trades on Ethereum mainnet, relying on the blob data system introduced by the Dencun upgrade (EIP-4844) earlier this year. Blobs significantly reduced the cost of posting compressed L2 data to Ethereum, allowing higher throughput without increasing mainnet load.\n\nOther major L2s — Base, Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, and Soneium — contributed smaller but steady portions to the total. The combined activity illustrates how Ethereum’s scalability now depends less on single-chain capacity and more on the aggregate throughput of its rollups.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is central to this shift. By moving large data payloads into blob space, rollups can cheaply record transaction data while still settling on Ethereum’s security layer. The result is a modular system where computation happens off-chain, but finality and verification remain on-chain. The current throughput numbers show that this structure is functioning as intended.\n\nIt’s also clear that the increase came from an application-specific rollup, not from general-purpose usage. Lighter’s focus on high-frequency perpetual trading naturally produces large volumes of small transactions, which are efficient to batch and verify. The performance gain shows what is possible when a specialized L2 design is matched to a specific workload.\n\nEthereum’s base layer remains the coordination and settlement layer for these rollups. The fact that the system can sustain this level of throughput without a network-wide stress event indicates that the scaling path through blobs and rollups is working.\n\nThe next step will be to see whether similar gains appear across other L2s running different workloads — payments, gaming, and general-purpose smart contracts — and whether throughput can grow without centralizing sequencers or compromising verification.\n\nFor now, the data shows a clear trend: Ethereum’s scaling is no longer theoretical.

This means that one day Ethereum could enable private transactions, contracts and identity systems, without breaking functionality or trust. Unlike Bitcoin which continues to be fully transparent, or ZCash that leaks metadata, Ethereum's smart contracts can have practical and composable privacy. Recently the Ethereum Foundation's new ZK privacy portal for real-world assets was launched and Vitalik's public support for ZKsync pumped ZK almost immediately.\n\nIf Ethereum finds a way to make this work then it will be the backbone of a truly private internet.. one nobody can turn off or watch.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/CloutedMind/status/1985351160245395941*", "lang": null, "likes": 21, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1oo6xhk/from_transparency_to_true_privacy_ethereums_final/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

BTC, for example, is almost like a religion for many people, inspiring devotion and loyalty. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is fun, playful, and brings joy to the community. ETH has a very smart and dedicated community, full of knowledgeable people, but at the same time, it can be a bit boring and overly serious. One of the biggest weaknesses I see in ETH is that it has no physical form and there is no effort to give it one.\nI am thinking about some kind of triangular concepts within ETH that are abstract and hard to visualize. They don’t look sexy or fun, and there’s nothing tangible to talk about in casual discussions. This makes it difficult for people to imagine, to create fun posts, or to generate memes related to it. If ETH had some physical form—like a mysterious liquid in a cup, measurable in litres or gallons—it could make the concept more approachable and entertaining. People could make memes like “full fuel tank” or other humorous visuals, which would make the community lively and engaging.\nI don’t think it’s the right time to invest in any crypto at the moment, but after a crash, ETH with some kind of physical representation could become a favorite among cryptocurrencies. It could attract fun people, those seeking a sense of community or “crypto religion,” and still leave room for nerds and serious enthusiasts 😀.\nHere is a visualization I made: https://imgur.com/a/5blJqgU", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1onm61c/no_physical_form/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

If you have stablecoins like USDC or USDT in a wallet, it feels like you own them. But you do not, not really. 0xMert_ on Twitter made this very clear, in a tweet he said that you cannot self-custody a stablecoin.\n\nIf you think about it, stablecoins like USDC and USDT are issued by companies. That means they have an on/off switch.. and they can flip it at any time. If regulators or courts demand it they can freeze or blacklist your wallet and this is something that has happened many times before. Last month alone Tether and TRON froze over $300 million linked to 'illegal activity.' A New York court even extended a freeze on $63 million in hacked USDC from Multichain. This kind of control you do not see with cash, or with something far better.. like ETH.\n\nETH lives on-chain, is permissionless and has no central issuer. Nobody can debase it, censor it, or take it from your wallet. This is what is called true self-custody. Stablecoins are convenient, for payments and to move money quickly, but they are not freedom money, they are convenience money. And so if you care about owning what is yours, you should understand the difference. ETH is freedom!!\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1984767763681067174\n* https://financefeeds.com/new-york-court-extends-freeze-on-63m-stolen-usdc/", "lang": null, "likes": 40, "replies": 60, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1on94ry/why_you_cannot_really_own_a_stablecoin/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

To support that, we're adopting a new compounding strategy for our LP position.\n\nFrom now on, monthly reports will have a new section showing updates and deposits into our position.\n\n**2. Rewriting r/EthTrader's topic limiter to use AI instead of regular expressions (?)**\n\nDonut DAO developer u/mattg1981 suggested that we upgraded the topic limiter to use AI instead of regular expressions. Even though regex works, sometimes it triggers false positives, needs manual maintenance and regular updates as new stablecoins / bridges / wallets / L2s / etc come out.\n\nAlso, the tool only checks the thread title. An AI based system could scan the whole thread (title / body / links) for a more accurate classification.\n\nNo one in the team opposed the idea, and it may move forward as a formal ETIP, once we confirm its long term feasibility.\n\n**3. Making the Donut DAO an Ethereum validator, with DONUT rewards for stakers (?)**\n\nDonut DAO contributors had a discussion about setting up an Ethereum validator, managed by the Donut DAO. Community members could also participate, depositing ETH into the pool. In this program, staking rewards would be shared between the treasury and stakers.\n\nWe also talked about rewarding stakers with Donuts.

According to Joseph Young on Twitter ETH is not just having a strong quarter, but it is also building momentum for the upcoming years. When you look at the data it is kind of hard to disagree, let's see:\n\n1. First: Ethereum owns the stablecoin market. Ethereum is currently hosting over $169 billion in issuance which is more than half of all stablecoins in the world. As U.S. regulations get better and more companies go on-chain that number will only grow.\n2. Second: Ethereum completely dominates DeFi. It has over $100 billion in total value locked, a lot of this is thanks to active L2's like Arbitrum and Base. No other network even comes close to this.\n3. Third: Institutions are finally accumulating ETH. BitMine, SharpLink, among others, big firms are treating ETH like digital gold and a treasury reserve for the future. If you take into consideration record-breaking ETF inflows it is obvious there is a lot of institutional demand.\n4. Finally: Ethereum keeps proving that it is the world computer. It has over 10 years of uptime, constant upgrades and an ecosystem of builders that is growing non-stop.\n\nEach of these markets: stablecoins, DeFi, institutions and infrastructure, could support trillion-dollar networks on their own.. Ethereum already leads in all 4.

That includes ETH, stETH, LP tokens, Aave positions, or WBTC — not just stablecoins like USDC. The assets stay on Ethereum Layer 1, continuing to earn yield, while traders open and manage positions on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nThe key innovation here is that this cross-layer collateralization is **fully verifiable through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs**, not bridges, oracles, or multisig custodians. Earlier systems couldn’t do this because ZK tech wasn’t mature enough to efficiently prove complex financial state changes (like order matching, margin calls, and liquidations) at scale. Lighter built custom ZK circuits and a specialized “Order Book Tree” that make it computationally feasible to verify every operation — including those involving collateral that never leaves Ethereum.\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Collateral stays on Ethereum (L1)** You lock ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or other supported assets into Lighter’s L1 smart contracts. They remain on Ethereum, keeping their native yield (e.g. stETH still earns staking rewards).\n2. **Collateral is registered in the L2 state** Lighter’s rollup records the locked asset in its state tree so it can be used for trading margin. The L2 handles execution through a low-latency sequencer and proves every transaction with ZK circuits.\n3. **Trading happens on L2** Orders are matched on a central-limit order book. You can trade any listed pair using the collateral value of your L1 assets. None of your assets move unless you’re liquidated.\n4. **Liquidations and settlements are cryptographically enforced** If a position becomes under-collateralized, the L2 generates a ZK proof of the liquidation event. That proof is submitted to Lighter’s Ethereum contract, which verifies it and automatically releases only the required portion of the locked collateral. No human intervention, no trust assumptions.\n5. **Full composability with DeFi** Because assets remain on Ethereum, they can still interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem — earning yield or being tokenized for use elsewhere. The same logic applies in reverse: DeFi positions can serve as margin on Lighter.\n\n# Why It’s Different\n\nPrevious perpetual DEXs and L1 derivatives platforms faced trade-offs:\n\n* **Bridges and oracles** introduced trust and delay (often hacked or manipulated).\n* **Monolithic alt-L1s** like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid had to rebuild their own ecosystems, isolating liquidity.\n* **Optimistic rollups** could not liquidate in real time due to challenge periods.\n* **ZK rollups** before now couldn’t efficiently prove multi-asset financial logic.\n\nLighter’s architecture removes these limits. Cross-margining multiple DeFi assets becomes **provably safe** — verifiable on Ethereum with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n# Why It Matters\n\n* **Capital efficiency:** traders can use yield-earning assets without selling or wrapping them.\n* **Security:** all collateral and state roots are settled on Ethereum; nothing depends on a bridge.\n* **Verifiability:** every trade, liquidation, and collateral adjustment is backed by a ZK proof.\n* **Integration:** native composability with Ethereum means Lighter can plug into existing DeFi protocols instead of competing with them.\n\nIf it works as described, UCM could shift on-chain trading from isolated collateral systems to a **capital-agnostic model**, where any Ethereum asset can serve as trustless margin — something earlier generations of DeFi simply couldn’t do.\n\n# Sources\n\nLighter whitepaper (October 2025) — discusses the core architecture, Order Book Tree, ZK-proof system and collateral logic. - [https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf](https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nInterview on the Bankless podcast with founder Vladimir Novakovski — confirms the roadmap including Universal Cross Margin and the ZKVM sidecar. - [https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex](https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex)", "lang": null, "likes": 5, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ojut2y/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

This is a shift from \"holding ETH as an asset\" to \"treating ETH as productive security collateral\" SharpLink Gaming (Nasdaq: SBET) announced plans to allocate roughly $200 million of its ETH treasury onto Linea, an Ethereum L2 blockchain developed by Consensys. The ETH will be staked and restaked through etherfi and EigenLayer-based infrastructure such as EigenCloud, with Anchorage Digital providing regulated custody.\n\nThis marks a shift from passive holding to active participation in Ethereum’s security economy. Instead of letting ETH sit on the balance sheet, SharpLink is locking it into validator and restaking contracts—earning yield while contributing to network security.\n\nRestaking, in this context, allows the same ETH collateral that secures Ethereum to also secure external protocols. These can include oracle networks, data-availability layers, or systems like \"verifiable AI\" that rely on cryptographic guarantees. In effect, ETH becomes programmable collateral: similar to gold, but capable of being configured to act as security capital for any protocol, to underwrite its digital infrastructure.\n\nRouting the deployment through Linea highlights how Ethereum’s scaling stack is maturing, and is no longer just a developer sandbox. Corporate treasuries can now interact with Ethereum's cryptoeconomic protocols.\n\nThe broader significance is structural: if more institutions treat ETH as productive security collateral, Ethereum evolves from a transaction platform into a base layer of economic trust whose security can be rented by other protocols. SharpLink’s move is very promising for that reason.", "lang": null, "likes": 17, "replies": 11, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ojermw/a_nasdaqlisted_company_plans_to_move_200m_of_eth/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

When most people hesitate, Tom Lee doubles down. The co-founder of Fundstrat and head of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) just bought another 27.3k ETH recently, about $113 million, bringing the company's total holdings to around 3.3 million ETH worth more or less $13 billion. Just to give you an idea that is 2.8% of all ETH in the world, all accumulated since July of this year.\n\nTom Lee's plan is not a small trade, it is among the biggest ever single-entity ETH accumulations in history and it is a big change for BitMine, a firm that used to focus on Bitcoin mining. Today it is making ETH a strategic reserve asset, a bet that ETH becomes the backbone of global finance. Some people say ETH's lack of a supply cap makes this risky, but Tom Lee could not care less. His conviction is the same of early Bitcoin believers but in this case, the bet is on Ethereum's economic machine rather than just on its scarcity.\n\nWhen the announcement came out BMNR pumped 4.5%, meaning that markets might agree with this. As Ryan Sean Adams so well put it on Twitter: 'Tom Lee is either a legend or a fool' because he 'left us no half measures.' In crypto's history those who make bold and insane bets like this tend to write the next chapter.

ETH and it's layer 2s with Base on top have become the top destination for new developers joining the crypto and blockchain space. No matter if they are open source contributors, startup teams or independent builders experimenting with on chain apps, Ethereum keeps attracting the largest share of fresh talent.\n\nOf course there are other that develop on Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche and others but the difference between them and Ethereum ecosystem is so big. Ethereum is the go to blockchain to build on.\n\nThe answer to this is probably a mix of maturity and momentum. Ethereum offers the richest ecosystem of dev tooling, it has a deep liquidity, a big active user base and a very robust funding infrastructure. Ethereum is a complete pack, from smart contract frameworks to rollup SDKs, from DAO to DeFi, this all makes the building phase a lot more smoother and more supported.\n\nThe good thing is that L2s like Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc are also in a good position, telling use that the whole ecosystem is great and that devs knows where the future is going to be.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1982822426045030784](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1982822426045030784)\n* Data: [https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/)", "lang": null, "likes": 22, "replies": 43, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1oix7ku/ethereum_and_its_l2s_dominate_the_builder/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Just silence and steady accumulation.\n\nEveryone's chasing the next shiny L1, or meme rally, or the next ETF headline. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been sitting around $4K, barely reacting to the noise. But it's obvious something big is brewing.\n\nWhales keep buying dips - quietly stacking hundreds of thousands of ETH while everybody else just scrolls past it. Stablecoin flows hit record highs. Real companies like Walmart, Shopify, Stripe - are actually using Ethereum rails for payments now.\n\nAnd the Fusaka upgrade that's coming in December could make the network 100x more efficient. ETH has seen this movie before. It always moves last.\n\nPeople get bored, start fading it, say it's \"stuck\" or \"dead\" or \"lagging\" and then out of nowhere it breaks out so hard it feels like the whole market was asleep at the wheel.\n\nAnd here's the thing: I don't think ETH is \"lagging\". I think it's being suppressed. Whales are loading up while the headlines stay quiet. The same pattern we saw in early 2020, in 2021 and even before the Merge. Every boring range was just an accumulation zone before the explosion.\n\nThis time while waiting I've just been letting my ETH stack compound quietly. Parked my bags on Nехо, earning more ETH daily while I wait for the move. No selling or stress - just steady growth against the same stack I plan to hold long term. The markets have matured, so it is not about timing the breakout anymore, it is more about staying positioned when it comes.\n\nSo yeah, I'm holding, staking, and ignoring the noise. Because once ETH decides to move, it won't give anyone time to think - it'll just go.

In a tweet posted by JourneyMacro a quote from Ethereum builder Grant Hummer points out one of the biggest misunderstandings in crypto. That is most people still think Ethereum is just another tech stock. At least that is how traditional investors see ETH, as a risky tech investment that pumps and dumps with market sentiment. The problem with their logic is that Ethereum is not a company trying to sell products or earn profits, instead it is a settlement layer. Ethereum is the system where digital money, assets and agreements live and move. This system is the foundation of the on-chain economy, when you understand this you start to see why Ethereum matters.\n\nETH is not something you trade for quick profits, it is the infrastructure that future finance will settle on. Every stablecoin, NFT, dApp and tokenized fund built on Ethereum is part of a bigger change.. one that is onboarding the next generation of investors. A not so distant future is coming where people will start using products and services that run on Ethereum, this will happen without them even realizing it. The ones who understand this now and see Ethereum as the trust engine of the internet and not as a stock, are already ahead of the curve.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/JourneyMacro/status/1981737978612605220*", "lang": null, "likes": 24, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1oi6tfs/ethereum_is_not_a_tech_stock_it_is_the_trust/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}
