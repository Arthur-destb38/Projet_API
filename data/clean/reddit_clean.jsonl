Considering borrowing against my Bitcoin I've been holding Bitcoin for about 2 years now and it's done pretty well. Got about $8k worth currently. The thing is I need around $3-4k for some unexpected expenses but I really don't want to sell my Bitcoin because I'm bullish long-term and don't want to trigger a taxable event.\n\nSomeone mentioned crypto loans where you can borrow cash using your Bitcoin as collateral. Sounds interesting but I honestly don't understand how it works or if it's a good idea.\n\nFrom what I've pieced together:\n\n* You put up your crypto as collateral\n* They lend you cash (USD, EUR, whatever)\n* You pay interest on the loan\n* Eventually you pay it back and get your crypto back\n\nBut I have a bunch of questions:\n\n**How much can you actually borrow?** Like if I have $8k in Bitcoin, can I borrow $4k? Or is it less because of some ratio thing?\n\n**What happens if Bitcoin price drops?** This is the part that worries me. If BTC crashes while I have a loan out, do they just take my Bitcoin? How does that work exactly?\n\n**What are the interest rates like?** Is it comparable to a personal loan from a bank or way higher?\n\n**Which platforms actually do this?** I've heard of Nexo and maybe YouHodler? Are there others? Are they safe or is this risky business?\n\n**Is this actually better than just selling?** I keep thinking maybe I'm overcomplicating this and should just sell $4k of Bitcoin, pay the taxes, and be done with it.

So far Gold has been on a killing spree depsite being dead for more than 40years in term of big price jumps. One thing I noticed but it's not mentioned by anyone is that every time gold goes up in price all the BTC and crypto goes down and then vice versa. Which probably mean (for all the people asking when BTC price will go crazy) the most likely outcome is - When gold starts to cool down and drops significantly from its ATH. Then those billions will flow in other assets like for example BTC and crypto market. One thing is for sure and that is nothing is certain but this makes sense when you see the big picture. Also remember that the power of BTC is in decentralisation and not solely the price. If you expect to become rich with BTC better not buy at all and that's because you don't understand what it stands for.

Bitcoin has a tradition: Asia often sells almost any setups, while Europe frequently acts as a source of liquidity-driven bids.

Also separately noted is DVOL’s behavior starting from 00:00 NY yesterday.\n\nOn 4h (DVOL vs BTC) the current DVOL level is clearly seen in a broader context. Historically, this range often acted as a local low for volatility and frequently preceded further spikes in IV, especially during sell-off phases. At the same time, it is worth noting that a strong and sustained break and close below this level in the past was accompanied by an ATH update.\n\nSo, we can conclude that although the situation, as always, remains ambiguous, nevertheless we are indeed trading near key levels both for Bitcoin and for DVOL.\n\nSpecial attention deserves tomorrow’s expiration, for which the trading day will likely be adjusted.

But this sideways price action isn't a sign of weakness—it’s a byproduct of market mechanics.\nFor most of December, we’ve been trapped in a \"Gamma Pin.\" There is a massive concentration of options sitting right at our current price levels. This forces market makers (dealers) to hedge their positions constantly:\n• As we dip toward $85k: Dealers have to buy to stay neutral.\n• As we push toward $90k: Dealers have to sell to stay neutral.\nThis creates an artificial ceiling and floor. It’s not that traders lack conviction; it’s that the \"Big Money\" is forced to keep the price in a box to manage their own risk. This is why we feel \"stuck\" even while gold and equities are hitting new highs.\nThat pressure is about to vanish. Roughly $27 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire this week, wiping out over 50% of the total open interest in the market. Once that \"gamma pressure\" decays, the invisible walls at $85k and $90k disappear.\nHistorically, when this kind of artificial suppression ends during low volatility, the price snaps toward the direction of the heaviest positioning. Right now, positioning is heavily skewed toward Calls with strikes sitting significantly higher than current levels.\nThe range wasn’t distribution—it was containment.

I run Monaco CPA, where I focus on crypto tax.\n\nI got into this by helping friends and family figure out their crypto situations. Then friends of friends. Then strangers on the internet. The questions kept getting harder, so I kept going deeper.\n\nWhen I'm not buried in transaction histories, I'm usually losing golf balls or hunting for the best donuts in the US. Always open to recommendations.\n\nThis isn't advice for your specific situation-just how I think about Bitcoin and taxes. The basics, the long-term stuff, and some angles that don't come up much.\n\n**What Matters Now**\n\nHolding Bitcoin isn't taxable. But actually using it—spending it, swapping it for another crypto, or using it as collateral in DeFi—usually is. The IRS treats crypto as property, so any time you dispose of it, you're triggering a potential gain or loss.\n\nIf you receive BTC from mining, work, staking, or rewards, it's generally taxable when you have \"dominion and control\"—basically, when you can actually sell or transfer it. The value at that moment becomes your cost basis going forward. This comes from Rev. Rul. 2023-14.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: if your staking rewards are locked with a mandatory unbonding period, you might be able to argue that income recognition is deferred until the tokens are actually accessible. Fair warning though—the IRS hasn't issued specific guidance on this, so it's a defensible position but not settled law. Could be challenged.\n\nOn holding periods: under a year gets taxed as ordinary income (up to 37% federal). Over a year gets the long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income.\n\n**2026 Long-Term Capital Gains Brackets (from Rev. Proc. 2025-32):**\n\n|Rate|Single|Married Filing Jointly|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0%|Up to $49,450|Up to $98,900|\n|15%|$49,451 – $545,500|$98,901 – $613,700|\n|20%|Over $545,500|Over $613,700|\n\nIf you're a high earner, don't forget the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax kicks in above $200K (single) or $250K (married). Those thresholds aren't indexed for inflation, by the way—they're set in stone under IRC 1411. So the effective top federal rate on investment income is really 23.8%.\n\n**The New Recordkeeping Situation**\n\nThis is a big deal that not enough people are talking about.\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, the IRS killed \"universal pooling\" for cost basis. Under the final regs (T.D. 10000) and Rev. Proc. 2024-28, you now have to track basis per-wallet or per-account. You can't sell Bitcoin on Coinbase and use a purchase you made on Kraken to determine your basis anymore.\n\nWhat happens if you transfer BTC to an exchange without providing your acquisition info? The broker might report your basis as \"unknown\" or just leave it blank. That puts 100% of the burden on you to prove what you actually paid. Some bigger custodians are starting to issue voluntary transfer statements, but most retail users aren't getting that.\n\n**Form 1099-DA timeline:**\n\n* 2025: Brokers report gross proceeds only (basis is optional)\n* 2026 and beyond: Basis reporting becomes mandatory for \"covered\" assets (stuff acquired after 2025)\n\nBottom line: we've moved from \"report what you want and hope for the best\" to \"prove your basis or potentially pay tax on the full amount.\"\n\n**The \"basis orphan\" problem.** A lot of early Bitcoin holders bought on multiple exchanges, moved everything to cold storage, and kept terrible records. If you're in that boat, transferring those old coins to a new exchange without documentation could mean the exchange reports zero or unknown basis. That's a problem. If this is you, start consolidating and documenting now. Chain forensics, old CSVs, bank statements—whatever you can dig up will help.\n\n**Where Things Get More Interesting**\n\n**Never selling—literally.** Some people plan to hold their Bitcoin until they die. Sounds morbid, but there's real logic here.\n\nWhen you die, your heirs get a stepped-up basis under IRC Section 1014. So if you bought BTC at $10K and it's worth $500K when you pass, your heirs inherit it at $500K. They can sell immediately and owe nothing.\n\n|Scenario|Original Basis|Value at Death|Sale Price|Taxable Gain|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|You sell during life|$10,000|—|$500,000|$490,000|\n|Heirs sell after inheritance|$10,000|$500,000|$500,000|$0|\n\nOne thing to watch: Congress has proposed eliminating stepped-up basis multiple times. It hasn't passed, but the legislative risk is real.\n\n**Borrowing against it instead of selling.** Some folks take out loans using their Bitcoin as collateral. You get cash, no taxable event—because borrowing isn't income.\n\nBut there are real risks:\n\n* If BTC drops and you get liquidated, that's a taxable sale at the worst possible time\n* Counterparty risk is real (ask anyone who used Celsius or BlockFi)\n* Interest eats into your returns\n\n**Retirement accounts.** This is one of the most powerful tools that people underuse.\n\nYou can hold Bitcoin inside a Roth IRA or Solo 401(k) through a self-directed custodian:\n\n* **Roth IRA:** You pay tax on contributions, but growth and withdrawals are tax-free forever. Bitcoin 100x inside a Roth? Zero capital gains tax. Ever.\n* **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions might be deductible, growth is tax-deferred, withdrawals get taxed as ordinary income.\n* **Solo 401(k):** If you're self-employed, the contribution limits are way higher.\n* **Brokerage windows:** Some employer 401(k) plans let you access a brokerage window where you can buy Bitcoin ETFs inside the tax-advantaged wrapper.\n\n**2026 Contribution Limits (per IRS Notice 2025-67):**\n\n|Plan Type|Standard Limit|Catch-Up (50-59, 64+)|Super Catch-Up (60-63)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|401(k) / Solo 401(k)|$24,500|$8,000|$11,250|\n|Traditional / Roth IRA|$7,500|$1,100 (now indexed)|N/A|\n|Total Solo 401(k)|$72,000|$80,000|$83,250|\n\n**SECURE 2.0 wrinkle:** If your W-2 wages were over $145K last year (or $150K for 2026), your catch-up contributions have to go into a Roth. The transition period technically ended 12/31/2025, but final regs delay enforcement to 2027 for most plans.\n\nHere's a different way to think about it: yes, you lose the immediate deduction. But if you believe Bitcoin is going to grow significantly, paying tax now for tax-free growth later might actually be the better deal.\n\n**QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock).** Some investors who've made big gains on Bitcoin redeploy into qualifying startups.\n\nUnder the OBBBA (for stock acquired after July 4, 2025):\n\n|Feature|Before|After|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Holding for 100% exclusion|5+ years|5+ years|\n|Tiered exclusions|None|50% at 3 years, 75% at 4 years|\n|Per-issuer cap|$10M|$15M (indexed after 2027)|\n|Gross asset limit|$50M|$75M (indexed after 2027)|\n\nImportant: these new rules only apply to stock acquired after July 4, 2025. Old QSBS is still under the old rules.\n\nThe strategy some people use: sell Bitcoin, invest in qualifying QSBS, hold 3+ years, exit with 50%+ of gains excluded, then roll into new QSBS under Section 1045. It's a way to create compounding tax-free growth that's not available with direct Bitcoin holdings.\n\n**Opportunity Zones.** If you have capital gains from selling Bitcoin, you can defer (and partially reduce) them by putting the proceeds into a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund within 180 days. Hold for 10+ years and the appreciation on the OZ investment is tax-free.\n\nNot simple though—you need an actual qualifying fund and a long time horizon.\n\n**State residency.** Don't forget state taxes.\n\n* **No income tax on wages/investments:** Texas, Florida, Wyoming, Nevada\n* **Washington:** No wage tax, but they do have a capital gains excise tax now—7% up to $1M, 9.9% above that. So it's not \"no tax\" for Bitcoin gains.\n* **High tax states:** California (13.3%), New York, New Jersey\n\nSome people with big unrealized gains move to a no-tax state before selling. But you have to actually move—domicile matters, not just a mailing address. California and New York audit aggressively using \"closer connection\" tests.\n\n**Charitable giving.** If you donate appreciated Bitcoin directly to a charity:\n\n* You get a deduction for the full fair market value\n* You pay zero capital gains tax on the appreciation\n\nThis works best with long-held BTC that's way up. Selling first and donating cash triggers the gain—don't do that.\n\nDonor Advised Funds are useful here. Contribute the Bitcoin, get the deduction now, recommend grants to charities over time.\n\nCharitable Lead Trusts are underused, especially in high-income years. The charity gets paid first for a set term, remainder goes to you or your heirs. If structured right, you get a big deduction now to offset a Bitcoin gain, then pay tax on trust income later. It's a tax-smoothing play.\n\n**Gifting.** A few things to know:\n\n* Annual exclusion: $19,000 per recipient (no gift tax return required)\n* Lifetime exemption: $13.99M individual / $27.98M married for 2025; jumps to $15M / $30M in 2026 under OBBBA\n* Recipient takes your cost basis\n\nThe OBBBA made the higher exemption permanent—no more sunset that would've dropped it back to \\~$7M.\n\n**\"Valuation trough\" gifting:** Bitcoin's volatility is actually useful here. Gift during a market dip and you \"freeze\" the value at a lower point, using less of your lifetime exemption. All the recovery happens outside your estate.\n\n**Puerto Rico (Act 60).** This is the most aggressive move. Relocate to PR, become a bona fide resident, and new capital gains after your move can be taxed at 0%.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Actually live there (183+ days/year)\n* Buy real property within 2 years\n* $10,000+ annual charitable donation (doubled from $5K under old Act 22)\n\nThe trap: there's a 10-year lookback rule under IRC 937(b). If you had built-in gains before you moved, selling within 10 years means those pre-move gains are still U.S.-sourced. Only gains that accrue after you establish residency get the 0% rate.\n\nThe IRS is not messing around here. They launched a task force in 2021, and they've already gotten criminal convictions. In U.S. v. Gajwani (June 2025), a guy pleaded guilty to backdating an S-corp election to hide $30M in gains. He got $15.3M in restitution and a year of probation.\n\nHere's the thing: investors who want Puerto Rico to avoid taxes on frequent trading are usually the worst fit for the strategy. It works best for people who hold long-term and trade rarely. Unless you're willing to sit on your positions for a decade after moving, it probably doesn't help if you already have big gains.\n\n**The Wash Sale Situation**\n\nCurrent law as of December 2025:\n\n* **Spot Bitcoin:** Classified as \"property\"—not subject to wash sale rules\n* **Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, BITO):** Securities—subject to wash sale rules\n\nThis creates an opportunity. You can sell a Bitcoin ETF at a loss, immediately buy spot BTC, and keep your exposure. Since they're different legal categories, the \"substantially identical\" rule doesn't apply.\n\nCaveats:\n\n* The IRS hasn't specifically ruled on cross-asset \"identicality\"\n* \"Substantially identical\" is a facts-and-circumstances test\n* Treasury has proposed extending wash sales to crypto, but Congress hasn't acted\n* This is a reasonable position but not bulletproof\n\nAdvanced version: hold both spot and ETFs. When you rebalance, harvest losses from whichever is down, then immediately buy the other to maintain exposure.\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\nBitcoin tax strategy isn't about \"avoiding taxes.\" It's about:\n\n* Knowing when tax is triggered\n* Deciding where your Bitcoin exposure lives (taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts)\n* Keeping your options open as laws change\n\n**What's different now:**\n\n|Category|Old Way|New Reality|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Broker reporting|Self-reported CSVs|Mandatory 1099-DA|\n|Cost basis|Universal pooling|Per-wallet only|\n|Gift exclusion|$18,000 (2024)|$19,000 (2025/2026)|\n|Solo 401(k) cap|\\~$69,000|$72,000 (2026)|\n|Catch-up rules|All pre-tax OK|High earners must use Roth|\n|QSBS exclusion|5-year minimum|Tiered (50% at 3 years)|\n|Wash sales|Proposed for crypto|No (spot) / Yes (ETFs)|\n\nThe new documentation requirements favor institutions. Custodial services will provide clean basis reporting. Individuals managing multiple wallets face serious reconciliation headaches. The regulatory direction is subtly pushing retail investors toward custodial solutions and away from self-custody.\n\nThe main risk now isn't under-reporting—it's documentation failure. If you can't prove your basis, you could pay tax on 100% of the proceeds.\n\nThe real edge isn't the trade. It's the structure you build around how you hold your assets.\n\n**Questions Worth Asking Yourself**\n\n* What's my actual time horizon with Bitcoin?\n* Am I optimizing for now or for decades from now?\n* Do I have retirement accounts I'm not using efficiently?\n* What state do I live in, and does it matter for my situation?\n* What would it look like if I never sold?\n\nHappy to discuss any of this at a high level. Can't give specific advice in the comments, but I'm always down to talk through concepts.\n\nAnd seriously—donut recommendations welcome.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pti4cb/bitcoin_and_taxes_whats_important_now_what_could/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Metrics like wallet activity, exchange inflows/outflows, and HODLer behavior suggest accumulation is accelerating. For example, the number of addresses holding 1 BTC or more continues to grow steadily, while exchange reserves are declining, indicating that long-term holders are increasingly moving coins off exchanges and out of circulation. At the same time, entities like miners are showing disciplined selling patterns, which historically reduces short-term supply shock risk.\n\nHash rate trends also remain robust, signaling continued network security and miner confidence despite price fluctuations. Combined with growing adoption of Lightning Network channels and Layer-2 activity, these metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s network is becoming both more secure and more liquid for peer-to-peer transfers. The overall picture shows **demand building from both retail and institutional actors while on-chain supply tightens**, which has historically correlated with upward price pressure over the medium to long term.\n\nI’m curious what others are seeing in the data: which on-chain indicators do you prioritize when assessing Bitcoin’s health and accumulation trends, and are there any signals that suggest we might be entering another HODLer-led phase?", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1psfhth/bitcoins_role_in_the_current_economic_landscape/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

For shts &amp; giggles. If Bitcoin runs 30% a year. So i ask Grok. And this what happened. \nWhat Michael Saylor talking about when he say bitcoin going up 30% a year. And how many years is that? If so how much 1 bitcoin will be?\n\nMichael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin advocate, made this statement during a keynote speech at Abu Dhabi Finance Week on December 9, 2025. He was discussing Bitcoin's role as a superior store of value and treasury asset for corporations and nations, countering critics who argue it lacks cash flows by emphasizing how it can generate returns through appreciation and strategic holding. In the speech, he directly said: \"I think Bitcoin is going to go up about 30% a year for the next 20 years.\"\n\nThis is a 20-year projection, taking Bitcoin's value from today out to roughly 2045.\n\nBased on Bitcoin's closing price of about $86,932 on December 17, 2025, a consistent 30% annual compounded growth over 20 years would put 1 BTC at approximately $16.5 million by the end of that period. (This is a straightforward compound growth calculation: Future Value = Present Value × (1 + 0.30)^20. Of course, this is a prediction, not a guarantee—markets are volatile, and past performance doesn't predict the future.)\n\nSo what will 0.1 bitcoin be?\n\nIf Michael Saylor's projection of Bitcoin appreciating at **30% per year** (compounded annually) over the next **20 years** holds true, then:\n\n- 1 BTC would be worth approximately **$16.5 million** in 2045 (as previously calculated, starting from around $87,000 today).\n\n- Therefore, **0.1 BTC** (which is 1/10th of a Bitcoin) would be worth approximately **$1.65 million** in 2045.\n\n### Quick math breakdown:\nThe future value formula is:  \nFuture Value = Present Value × (1 + growth rate)^years  \n\nFor 1 BTC: ~$87,000 × (1.30)^20 ≈ $16,521,395  \n\nFor 0.1 BTC: $16,521,395 × 0.1 = **$1,652,140** (roughly $1.65 million)\n\nAgain, this is purely based on Saylor's speculative 20-year forecast—Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and no one can guarantee future returns. Past performance isn't indicative of future results!\n\nHow much will milk and eggs be?\n\nIf Michael Saylor's **30% annual compounded appreciation** for Bitcoin over the next **20 years** comes true (leading to ~$16.5 million per BTC in 2045), the key question for everyday items like **milk** and **eggs** is: in what terms are we measuring their price?\n\n### Current prices (December 2025, US averages):\n- A **gallon of milk**: around **$4.00–$4.50** (conventional whole milk; organic is higher, often $8–$9).\n- A **dozen large Grade A eggs**: around **$2.00–$3.50** (recent drops after earlier avian flu spikes pushed them much higher).\n\n### In fiat dollars (USD) in 2045:\nAssuming typical long-term US inflation of **~2–3% per year** (current market expectations and projections hover around 2%), prices would rise modestly:\n- Milk: roughly **$6–$10** per gallon.\n- Eggs: roughly **$3–$6** per dozen.\n\n(These are broad estimates—actual prices depend on supply chains, energy costs, regulations, etc.)\n\n### In Bitcoin terms (satoshis or BTC) in 2045:\nThis is where Saylor's bullish vision shines for BTC holders. Bitcoin is designed as a **deflationary asset** (fixed supply of 21 million coins). If its value rises dramatically while fiat inflates (even mildly), goods and services become **much cheaper when priced in Bitcoin**.\n\nUsing the same math:\n- Today's ~$4.20 gallon of milk costs about **~4,800 satoshis** (at BTC ~$87,000).\n- In 2045, at $16.5M per BTC, that same gallon (assuming ~$7 in inflated USD) would cost only **~42 satoshis**—over **100x cheaper** in BTC terms.\n- Eggs would drop from ~3,000–4,000 sats today to **~30–50 sats** per dozen.\n\nIn a \"hyperbitcoinization\" scenario (widespread BTC adoption as Saylor envisions), everyday groceries like milk and eggs would feel **incredibly affordable** to Bitcoin holders—potentially cheaper than they've ever been in sound money terms, thanks to productivity gains and Bitcoin's appreciating purchasing power.\n\nOf course, this is highly speculative. Bitcoin's growth isn't guaranteed, and adoption timelines are uncertain. But in Saylor's projected world, holding BTC makes basics like milk and eggs **way cheaper** over time.\n\n16.5 million in 2045 will feel like what 1 million ?\n\nIn Michael Saylor's hypothetical 2045 scenario (with 1 BTC at ~**$16.5 million**), the question of what that amount of money \"feels like\" in terms of purchasing power boils down to adjusting for expected **USD inflation** over the next 20 years.\n\n### Long-term US inflation context\n- The Federal Reserve targets ~2% annual inflation.\n- Historical long-term average (since 1913) is around 3.1%, but recent decades and current market expectations are closer to **2–2.5%**.\n- Market-based forecasts (e.g., Cleveland Fed models, breakeven rates) suggest around **2.5%** average over long horizons like 20–30 years.\n\n### Purchasing power calculation\nUsing a conservative **2.5%** annual inflation rate (compounded):\n\n- Prices in 2045 will be about **1.64 times** higher than today.\n- Therefore, **$16.5 million in 2045 dollars** would have the same purchasing power as roughly **$10 million** in today's (2025) dollars.\n\n(Quick math: Future value factor = (1 + 0.025)^20 ≈ 1.64  \nPresent equivalent = $16,521,395 / 1.64 ≈ **$10.07 million** today.)\n\n### Range of estimates\nIf we use different rates:\n- At **2%** inflation (Fed target): ~**$11.1 million** today.\n- At **3%** (closer to historical average): ~**$9.1 million** today.\n\nSo, in a realistic scenario, **$16.5 million in 2045** would feel like **$9–11 million** in current money—truly life-changing wealth, enough for multiple luxury homes, private jets, or generational financial security.\n\n### Tie-back to everyday items\nAs we discussed earlier with milk (~$4/gallon today) and eggs (~$2–3/dozen today, after recent drops):\n- In 2045 fiat dollars, they'd cost maybe $6–7 for milk and $4–5 for eggs (at 2.5% inflation).\n- But to a Bitcoin holder with that appreciated wealth, they'd still feel trivially cheap—like pennies today.\n\nThis is the core of Saylor's argument: Bitcoin's projected appreciation could massively outpace fiat inflation, dramatically increasing your real-world buying power over time. Of course, it's a bold forecast—actual outcomes depend on adoption, regulation, and macro factors.\n\nU.S. national averages as of late 2025, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and USDA reports.\n\nSo… how many sats for a dozen eggs in 2045? 🥚😏\"\nor\n\"Still think holding fiat is smart? 🤔\"", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pp0bdo/i_was_just_got_finish_listening_to_mike_talks_for/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

I’m looking for perspective from others in their mid-20s who have most of their net worth in Bitcoin.\n\nI’m 25 and turning 26 next year. I’ve been investing heavily in Bitcoin since I was 20 while working a well-paying corporate 9–5. At this point, roughly \\~**75% of my net worth is in BTC**, about **20% in 401k / IRA**, and the rest is in **cash for emergencies / liquidity** (even though I don’t love holding fiat… but we still live in a fiat world).\n\nI fully believe in Bitcoin long-term and plan to keep stacking regardless of price.

But right now, in my 20s, it feels more like I’m hoarding something incredibly valuable without a clear plan for translating it into a life.\n\nI’m NOT bearish, not doubting Bitcoin — just trying to hear how others with similar exposure are thinking about the future. **What’s your plan?**\n\nWould really appreciate hearing different perspectives even if you aren't in your mid 20s and if you're older what would you tell your younger self.

So I have a couple of thoughts about this.  First it says if you are in profit of said bitcoin that you are paying your taxes in, you don't have to pay capital gains. So theoretically, lets say you have an LLC and pay your taxes at tax time April of the following year.  You could DCA each week into bitcoin rather than setting aside cash for taxes, and although you could be in the hole, you could also be up depending on the increase in bitcoins price that year.  But here's where I see it getting interesting, if the government is going to keep said bitcoin as a part of their treasury and never sell, then effectively they are printing to \"buy\" bitcoin.  Because that tax \"revenue\" collected in BTC wont go to fund anything, and the government will essentially have to print to make up the difference in the budget.

That alone raises several questions.\n\nFirst: how does someone with such an extraordinary understanding of cryptography, incentives, and attack surfaces make such a basic operational-security mistake? Letting an email account go inactive for years while it contains historically sensitive communication is an enormous risk. Forgetfulness seems unlikely at that level.\n\nSecond: why GMX in the first place? Even by the standards of the late 2000s, GMX was not known for strong security or privacy guarantees. Choosing one of the weakest mainstream email providers feels inconsistent with the mindset that designed Bitcoin.\n\nThird: why didn’t this become a much bigger issue from a law-enforcement or intelligence standpoint? If anyone could theoretically identify Satoshi, it would be the email provider — via login records, IP addresses, timestamps, or metadata. Why was GMX never forced, publicly or quietly, to hand over everything they had? Or were they?\n\nFourth: how was it possible to run BitcoinTalk, register domains, and host infrastructure without the registrar or hosting provider being able to tie this back to a real identity? Either the OPSEC was near-perfect in some areas — or imperfect in others, which again feels contradictory.\n\nAnd finally, the coins. Roughly 1.1 million BTC (give or take) have never moved. Why? This isn’t about price — Bitcoin’s fundamentals wouldn’t change — but from a market-psychology perspective, Satoshi could trigger massive panic among weak hands at any time. The fact that this never happened is, in itself, one of the strongest signals we have.\n\nNone of this is meant to undermine Bitcoin. Quite the opposite. I’m genuinely curious how people here reconcile these inconsistencies. Are we overestimating Satoshi’s OPSEC? Or underestimating how much was intentionally left behind?\n\nWould love to hear thoughtful takes — not myths or hero worship, but grounded explanations.", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 12, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pn3vfj/revisiting_satoshi_nakamoto_opsec_gmx_and_the/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Every ten minutes the system randomly selects one winning field on a grid of unimaginable size. Players use real electricity and buy specialized machines to guess as many fields as fast as possible. The first player to hit the winning field gets points written into a public scoreboard.\n\n\n\nCrucially, every winning guess is sealed with an enormous amount of computational work. This makes it practically impossible to go back and rewrite past scoreboard entries without redoing all the work from that point forward, faster than the rest of the network combined. This costly proof is marketed as the game’s killer feature: the scoreboard is now “immutable” and “ultra-secure.” No one can steal or erase your points without spending insane amounts of energy.\n\nJohn hits the winning field and gets 1 point written into the scoreboard. Alice runs five times as much hardware and gets 5 points. The points are simply the result of who expended more energy.\n\nNow Steve comes along and pays 100 000 dollars to have John’s point transferred to him on the scoreboard while John’s score is reset to zero.\n\nQuestion: did Steve invest? Did John and Alice create tokens, money, or assets? No, it is absurd to even ask.\n\nThis is exactly how Bitcoin works. Instead of guessing fields, players (incorrectly called miners) try to guess the hash number that the network has set as the target. The first to guess it gets point (BTC) written into the public scoreboard (the blockchain). Every new block is sealed with the same enormous computational proof that makes rewriting history astronomically expensive. This proof is marketed as Bitcoin’s main value proposition: your points are “seizure-resistant digital property.”\n\nBut here is the crucial point: this has nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy. Let us explain why.\n\nInvesting presupposes the existence of a resource that generates a return.\n\nWith stocks, there is a company with economic activity. The number 100 is not points but a measure of the size of your share in that company. The return in the form of dividends, buybacks, or liquidation proceeds comes from that resource. A higher number means you are entitled to a higher return.\n\nThe dollar is a more complex type of investment where the resource is debt. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of thin air. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and machines and produces, for example, a car. You buy the car and pay in dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives those dollars, it simply deletes them from its balance sheet and they disappear. You received a car, and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished. The return in the form of the car came from the company that owed the bank.\n\nAnother example: you pay taxes to the state in dollars. The state uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are deleted from the Fed’s balance sheet and disappear from the market. You received a service (your tax obligation was erased and you are not going to jail). That return again came from the debtor, this time the state.\n\nSo the numbers in the above cases quantify the share in resources (company and debt) that generate returns. Bitcoin is not issued as a share in a company or as someone’s debt, so there is no resource generating a return for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin is literally issued only as a point in a guessing game, and the only thing being secured by all the expensive proof is the point table itself.\n\nThese points are also not tokens, money, or assets, because all such things involve some obligation, physical substance, or digital content.\n\nA token represents an obligation of the issuer: 100 on a casino chip or gift card means the issuer owes money or goods, and a larger number means a larger obligation. With physical substances such as grain, metal, or oil, and with digital ones such as MP3s, videos, e-books, or apps, a larger number means you hold more mass, more volume, or more digital content.\n\nIf John has 100 BTC and Alice has 1 BTC, that does not mean the issuer owes John a hundred times more money or goods. It does not mean John holds a hundred times more physical material or digital files. It only means he has a larger number on the scoreboard. Just as there is no resource to invest in, there’s no substance to be a token, money, or an asset.\n\nThe expensive proof does not change anything fundamental: the only thing being secured is the scoreboard itself, and the only reason miners keep producing that proof is that the points on the scoreboard still command a price. When that price collapses far enough, miners turn off their machines, the security collapses with it, and the ultra-secure points instantly become trivially rewriteable points again.\n\nIt is funny (and a little sad) how many people do not realize that Bitcoin is just a giant, energy-intensive, self-referential guessing game in which participants bet that someone will keep paying to maintain the illusion that meaningless points are valuable because they are “secure,” and they are “secure” only as long as people keep paying for them.\n\nThe whole thing remains technological nonsense and has literally nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pkm4zg/bitcoin_as_technological_nonsense_a_pointless/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

If 2026 ends up being an up year, that would directly contradict the model.\n\nSo what would actually break the cycle?\n• Losing long-term support for an extended period\n• No meaningful new highs within a reasonable post-halving window\n• Long-term holders selling into weakness\n• 2026 behaving like an expansion year instead of a reset\n\nWhat would keep it alive?\n• Holding long-term structure\n• Another ATH that holds, not just a brief spike\n• A clear post-peak cooldown in 2026\n\nNone of this proves the cycle is dead yet, but between timing, structure, and behavior, it does feel like the 4-year model is being tested in a real way.\n\nHonestly, even reading my own bullet points makes me scratch my head. That this is what it takes to either confirm or disproved the cycle. It seems to me that it has clearly been changed, but the dagger in the heart will be 2026 being an expansion green year.", "lang": null, "likes": 37, "replies": 78, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pkdqnx/is_the_4year_bitcoin_cycle_already_breaking_down/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

I'm a college student currently and I do have BTC. I'm not someone who has that much money to spend, but I do have some, and this is not a way to antagonize. It's a clear headed way of looking at it, hopefully.\n\nBitcoin is a bet on demand and adoption, isn't it? It's what I think. Do it irresponsibly and you might even call it a gamble. Its true, as money it's bad (at its current state, I think you all know why). As a hedge against inflation? It's been here for 16 years with no concise way of knowing it'll stay or keep its performance. Intrinsically, its backed by speculators (my opinion).\n\nIt's a bet that enough people believe it'll go up, that is, more people will also believe it as a way to increase their money. If enough people believe it for long enough, it may get a little bit of a normative position in society's view of finance. But that's only \"if\". If enough believe in it, it might stay valuable. \"If\". Eventually with increased marketcap, it'll be harder to make money there and then it'd be like, well, an alternative to gold, really. Or, the cycle could become the norm and it'd be an asset where people gamble for periods of times.\n\nBitcoin is a gambled speculative allocation based on long term belief adoption. And your allocation probably should be how comfortable you are with that, 1-5% probably (Consider enough exposure if it succeeds, while not enough pain if it fails). It's a bet on adoption and demand, some people want that bet, some don't. Bitcoin is not guaranteed, not inevitable, not backed by fundamentals, not a proven hedge, not money today. Again, it's a bet on adoption and demand (some people want that bet, some don't.)\n\nThank you and do engage if you say there's an aspect missed so that others consider it.\n\nI made a recent post in the most bearish sub for bitcoin (you know which sub), and they should have pointers to consider on why bitcoin adoption and demand making it into a financial norm in some way or niche has difficulties.\n\nedit: typo", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pk97xg/a_view_on_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Spot XRP exchange-held reserves have fallen sharply, with estimates suggesting only around 1.5 billion XRP remain on trading platforms as of late December 2025. \n\nKey Insights\nSupply Dynamics: The supply of XRP on centralized exchanges has contracted significantly, a trend widely interpreted as a sign of institutional accumulation and long-term holding rather than active trading.

This contrasts with outflows seen in some Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs during the same period, suggesting a potential decoupling of XRP from broader market trends.\nMarket Sentiment: While consistent institutional inflows point to long-term confidence, the price has remained in a range-bound, weak pattern, leading some analysts to note a divergence between on-chain data and price action.\nPotential for Supply Shock: Analysts suggest that this imbalance between strong, persistent demand from ETFs and the rapidly decreasing supply on exchanges could lead to a significant supply shock by early 2026, potentially driving a major price movement if retail demand increases.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pz3k0q/day_of_recogning/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

EVM in two weeks. \n**Dusk (DUSK) quick summary — what they’re trying to accomplish (and why anyone should care)**\n\nDusk is building a **privacy-first, compliance-friendly L1** aimed at **regulated finance / RWAs** — basically: bring real-world financial instruments on-chain while keeping sensitive data confidential *and* still workable for institutions.\n\n**Core thesis**\n\n* Most chains are either “fully transparent DeFi” or “privacy at all costs.”\n* Dusk is trying to be **confidential + auditable + regulator-compatible** for things like securities issuance, trading, settlement, and compliant DeFi. ([dusk.network][1])\n\n**How they’re doing it (architecture)**\nDusk is moving to a **3-layer modular stack**:\n\n* **DuskDS** = consensus / data availability / settlement layer (foundation)\n* **DuskEVM** = EVM execution layer (Solidity + normal Ethereum tooling)\n* **DuskVM** = future privacy-focused VM layer (for heavier privacy apps) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\n**Why the EVM layer matters**\nDuskEVM is meant to reduce friction so devs can use **Hardhat/Foundry** and deploy Solidity contracts like on any EVM chain, while still settling to DuskDS. ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\nNotable quirks from their docs:\n\n* DuskEVM currently inherits a **“7-day finalization period”** (their wording) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n* **No public mempool** (transactions are only visible to the sequencer right now) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n* Docs list **Mainnet chain ID 744** + official RPC/explorer URLs (and note mainnet “Live: No” while testnet is live). ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\n**Institution angle / regulated rails**\nDusk is leaning hard into the “regulated edge” narrative via **NPEX** (a licensed Dutch trading venue), claiming it brings a suite of licenses into the stack and helps enable regulated issuance/trading/settlement. ([dusk.network][1])\nThey’ve also pushed interoperability/market-data standards via **Chainlink + NPEX** for regulated assets on-chain. ([PR Newswire][3])\nAnd there’s reporting on 21X (DLT Pilot Regime venue) collaborating with Dusk, with Dusk onboarding initially as a trade participant. ([Ledger Insights][4])\n\n**Timeline / catalyst**\n\n* Dusk shipped a **DuskDS L1 upgrade on Dec 10, 2025**, framed as the “final release before DuskEVM mainnet.” ([tradingview.com][5])\n* **EVM mainnet launch:** community/team chatter in Discord suggests it was “this month” then slipped **~2 weeks**. I *can’t* find a public dated announcement to cite, so treat the “two weeks” as **target/estimate**, not a guarantee.\n\n**TL;DR**\nDusk is trying to be **the chain for compliant, privacy-preserving financial markets**, using a modular stack where **EVM is the “easy dev onboarding” layer** and privacy/compliance is the differentiator.

Also, our own relationship with scarcity and its psychology. \n\nI preface this by saying there is no such thing as a perfect financial system at this juncture, the best hope is for more forward thinking humans that care deeply about sustainable futures, while also being wise about innovation and novelty.\n\nWith that said...\n\nI thought about the best metaphor that I can think of to get a sense of my current perspective.\n\nLets use sports and trading cards/jerseys. (I leaned towards using Michael Jordan as a metaphor, but I think Tom Brady fits better.)\n\nLets say that the National Footbal League underwent a massive scandal and lost much of its popularity and trust/viewership. The salary cap was becoming unsustainable to pay the star players and the demand was very uneven.\n\nTom Brady comes out of obscurity as a 6th round pick... Essentially undrafted for all intents and purposes of this example.\nThe NFL instituted that to draw more fans and network effect, they will be taking a game jersey for every player and will make tiny square patches to distribute in a limited supply trading card.\n\nTom Brady's patch is worth less than a penny to start.\nThe star player from the Patriots goes out with a near season ending injury and Tom gets his chance to start.\nSlowly, his patch value goes up as he performs well and builds a network effect of fans.\n\nHe becomes a super bowl winner and his patch value skyrockets... It even becomes very speculative in the \"ceiling\" of its value. His patch value crashes a good amount because of the off-season and people lost interest in football.\n\nAs football season starts, more activity on his jersey patches raise the value of each patch. Very early on the price action is very volatile (but trends up overall due to interest) because we are not sure about if he can sustain his own performance. I.E. injury/computer hacks, swan events, something better (like ethereum) comes out where the QB is more mobile... Think Vince Young, Michael Vick, etc.\n\nYet the same rule applies. Only a limited amount of game jerseys will ever be produced. Those who got the earliest game jerseys have the biggest \"fan  network effect.\"\n\nWhen it gets really speculative, they can simply cut up a piece of a patch even more... Down to its smallest unit and call it a Brady (Satoshi) so that everyone can own a piece of Tom Brady.\n\nAs we know, Tom Brady played for many many years and was very successful (perhaps the greatest QB of all time). There are no more Tom Brady Jersey's being produced.\n\nFootball continues (money printing/Traditional currency). Tom Brady is still going quite strong at peak interests because he is the GOAT of football. \n\nBut eventually, his name will lose steam over time as the \"show\" goes on. He may very well still hold a good amount of value as his name will still hold a prominence (just like stars from older generations and their value). \n\nBut, to say... Every player will be pegged to Tom Brady for its value is not the best system going forward because Tom Brady was not the NFL. \n\nThe NFL enabled Tom Brady to gain prominence. People love Tom Brady so much (The biggest fans who got in early) that they try to build a narrative that the NFL should change its name to the TBFL (Tom Brady Football League) and as a nice little fun coincidence, his last Super Bowl win was with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His legacy is now even more cemented for the naysayers of his greatness.\n\nAfter his retirement from football, jerseys are still being produced, new players and even more fun and vibrant colors and logos are being created to fit the time and to keep the interest in the league.\n\nTom Brady didnt fail, he was awesome and great for his time... Perhaps needed to help gain more trust in the system again, and to have the system become more creative in keeping \"interest\" in the league. \n\nBut to say his name and likeness should replace the league all together would not be wise at all. \n\nHe can no longer play at his level and sustain performance and interest for the League as a whole... He would also suppress the value for new players and their performance because everything is pegged to him.\n\nHe is still remembered, and his scarce Jersey's are highly valuable, but they do not comprise the value of the entire NFL.\n\nMore \"Value\" will always be generated in the League and new ways and players to sustain performance.\n\nNew fans will not care as much about Tom Brady because he was from a different Era. \n\nThere are also no more of his patches that they can easily get at a meaningful level because all of the patches have already been distributed.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pw97eg/my_personal_view_on_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

And how does Ethereum address this? ####**Is Decentralization merely a buzz word and a means to an end?**\n\nUltimately, everyone wants:\n\n1. **Availability and fault tolerance**: The blockchain continues running even when some nodes are unavailable.\n2. **Safety**: Network operators can't seize or use assets without permission.\n3. **Censorship-resistance**: Network operators can't censor valid transactions.\n4. **Transparency/auditing**: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger and verifiable through permissionless nodes.\n\n####**Full decentralization isn't necessary to obtain these security properties.**\n\nThere is no blockchain that exists today with full decentralization. Fortunately, there are ways to acquire security through **protocol design** without needing full decentralization. Features like L2 exit hatches and recovery through a proof system provide anti-censorship properties regardless of whether the L2 network is centralized. \n\nOther designs like Attestor-Proposer-Builder Separation create a separation of powers where the builder can be centralized, but overall block production is decentralized due to proposers and attestors being decentralized. (This is the opposite of proof-of-work where a miner is single-handedly responsible for building, validating, and proposing the block.)\n\nIf decentralization were absolutely important, we wouldn't be using mining pools, staking pools, CEXs, L2 networks, and wallets that rely on RPCs. The Nakamoto Coefficient measures the number of bad entities it takes to compromise a network. If decentralization were absolutely important, we'd be avoiding networks with low Nakamoto Coefficients like Bitcoin and Ethereum. And we'd be avoiding networks with low client diversity, or with high miner/validator hardware requirements.\n\n####**How does Ethereum addresses security?**\n\nDespite having a low Nakamoto Coefficient, Ethereum fundamentally still has all the benefits of decentralization because it is designed with:\n\n* **Very high economic security and safety** from Proof-of-stake. Aligned economic interests where the people holding the token are incentivized to protect it. Cannot be attacked by miners without economic stake.\n* **Very high client diversity** with 10+ independent client dev teams to allow for fault tolerance and high decentralized governance\n* **Deterring malicious actors** by slashing validators who act badly. This increases economic security.\n* **Providing Economic finality** through its Casper-CBC finality gadget, which also prevents long-range attacks and deep reorgs\n* **Providing sustainable security budget** through EIP-1559 and validator rewards to support network security indefinitely\n* **Attestor-Proposer-Builder Separation**: Ethereum builders are centralized. However, that doesn't matter since there is attestor-proposer-builder separation where the builders are separated from the nodes proposing the blocks, which are also different from the nodes validating the blocks. This separation will be further enshrined in the upcoming Glamsterdam update.\n* **Layer 2 rollups at Stage 1-2 inherit the security of L1** despite having centralized sequencers because honest transactions can be forced, and dishonest transactions can be economically-reversed through proof mechanisms even without the support of the centralized sequencer.\n\n####**How does Bitcoin addresses security?**\n\nAnd despite having a low Nakamoto Coefficient, Bitcoin has ... umm ... none of these.... Sorry, never mind.\n\nI'm sure the adoption of Stratum v2 miner-submitted block templates will eventually pick up by the year 2050.\n\nAnd we can only hope they figure out a sustainable security budget protocol.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1puut50/is_decentralization_merely_a_means_to_an_end_and/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Liquidity remains thin, funding rates are stretched, and macro uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment. Even with repeated attempts to push higher, the market keeps running into resistance, showing that conditions need to improve before a clean breakout can happen.\n\nWhat’s interesting is how traders are adapting in this environment. Instead of waiting for BTC to move, many are finding opportunities in alternative assets.  One trader shared how they were trading UXLINK on Bitget during the Crazy 48H, and managed to earn, despite Bitcoin’s sideways action. It’s a reminder that while BTC sets the tone, there are other ways to stay active and profitable in the market.\n\nLooking ahead, the key factors to watch are whether liquidity returns, funding rates normalize, and macro sentiment eases.

Making it a legit business so I could expense &amp; capitalize stuff. Watching endless youtube videos on the best gpu builds.  My first wooden gpu frame (still have it),  buying the 12 bay octominers, buying bitcoin miners,  upgrading my electrical panel to run them.    Buying Kaspa miners  (my by far largest crypto loss)  And now... dusty used equipment that I've  been meaning to clean up and sell for ages but never quite seem to have enough time to get around to doing.\n\nNowadays I have automatic dca set up for Bitcoin and Eth again. Lol,  like the old days  but a lot more convenient.   (Who else remembers buying Bitcoin on Ebay way way way back?  #regrets for losing that wallet key).    \n\nI look  back at it,  the hours spent, the interactions with the crytpo community, the profit (of course) ,  and  I smile.  It was a really good time in my life.  Things change and times moves on, but that cycle will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nAll but one of my shitcoins are gone now  (most gone to zero or lost on Tradeogre and Xeggex).   Lol,  the sole survivor shitcoin - TCG World.    I checked in on their Telegram recently.  Looks like their crypto based game is close the being a closed alpha? Beta?  I'll give them this , they had a vision and are sticking with it.  Maybe if I hold it for another 4 years I'll break even on it :D\n\nDid I get rich off crypto?   Nope.  It's going to sound super cliche, but the real reward was the journey and friends made along the way.

It’s end of 2025, and “altseason” has quietly been pushed from 2024 to 2025 to now maybe 2026. What’s changed isn’t timing, it’s belief. Fewer people actually think it’s coming anymore.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality is that altcoins used to rally on new buyers. That buyer base is basically gone. Crypto Twitter, maybe \\~50k people, already owns altcoins. These are cycle veterans, already exposed, already burned, already allocated. There’s no fresh capital here to move markets.\n\nRetail is fragmented and underfunded. The only entities that can actually move prices are funds, institutions, and wealthy allocators. They draw the chart. And they are not buying altcoins.\n\nWhy? Because most altcoins don’t represent ownership.\n\nGovernance tokens especially have been exposed over the past year. On paper, token holders vote. In practice, turnout is tiny, execution is optional, and core teams or foundations retain override powers under “security” or “urgency.” When votes conflict with insider preferences, outcomes get delayed, reframed, or bypassed. Over time, rational holders stop participating. Governance turns into theater.\n\nSky(MakerDao) is a good example. Votes happened. Debates happened. And yet major decisions were effectively decided elsewhere. Participation collapsed once it became clear votes didn’t constrain outcomes.\n\nEven if governance worked perfectly, it still wouldn’t solve the core issue: institutions don’t buy voting rights. They buy ownership.\n\nThis leads to the deeper structural flaw: the DAO vs devco split. Tokens live in DAOs. Teams, IP, trademarks, and execution live in labs companies. When acquisitions happen, buyers acquire the devco, not the DAO. The token isn’t bought. Holders don’t benefit. We’ve seen this repeatedly with Tensor, Padre, Axelar, and others.\n\nThe people and IP move on. The token is left governing an empty shell.\n\nThis problem even applies to Ethereum. ETH is a utility token, not ownership. It doesn’t guarantee cash flows, equity, or control. Its valuation depends on demand and relevance, not rights. And relevance is fragile in a world of L2s, fee compression, and improving tech.\n\nInstitutions aren’t avoiding altcoins because they “don’t get crypto.” They’re avoiding them because there’s nothing to own.\n\nUntil tokens represent real ownership, enforceable rights, or cash flows, altcoin season probably stays a meme. Fixing that likely means regulation, securities, and a very different crypto culture.\n\nAnd that’s the real tradeoff no one wants to talk about.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nSince this post got some attention, I made a YouTube video about it: [https://youtu.be/igwZzJuZWNw](https://youtu.be/igwZzJuZWNw)", "lang": null, "likes": 300, "replies": 251, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pr0d56/altseason_is_canceled_forever/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.", "lang": null, "likes": 248, "replies": 58, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pq29wl/vitalik_buterin_warns_elon_musk_that_xs_hate/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Every time the market pulls back, the sentiment flips instantly. People start talking like the entire industry has stalled out.. meanwhile, in the background, adoption is accelerating faster than ever. It's almost comical how disconnected price and reality can be in this space.\n\nLook around: governments are openly discussing Bitcoin strategy, Japan is lowering crypto taxes, stablecoins are basically the default remittance rail in half of LATAM, tokenization is becoming an actual banking product, and institutions keep building even if they're not shouting about it. None of that looks like an industry losing momentum.\n\nAnd the mainstream spillover is getting harder to ignore. Sports, entertainment, retail - all of it is slowly tying itself into crypto infrastructure. A good example is how several digital-asset companies have landed major partnerships this year. Nexo showing up as the crypto partner for the Australian Open (and other big sporting events earlier in the year) is the kind of thing you wouldn't have seen during past downturns. You don't get that level of visibility unless the industry is moving into the normal part of life category.\n\nThat's why I find the current doom-and-gloom narratives funny. Prices dip - they always do - but the underlying adoption curve hasn't slowed at all. If anything, the pace of real-world integration is faster now than when the market was euphoric. Historically, this is the phase where people hesitate... then look back two years later and wonder why they ignored all the obvious signals.\n\nAnd honestly, at some point the pattern becomes impossible to ignore. Every dip gets framed as \"the end\" and every time the world just absorbs more crypto into daily life. You can only watch governments weaken their currencies, watch institutions move on-chain, watch real-world businesses adopt this stuff and watch global events partner with crypto companies for so long before the picture becomes obvious.\n\nPeople get scared by the short-term noise, but the long-term trend feels almost baked into the structure now. Maybe the real risk isn't the downturns - maybe it's assuming these moments will always last. Because if crypto really does keep sliding into the role fiat used to play, then hesitating at the lows will look a lot different in hindsight than it does in the moment.\n\nTake the headlines how you want, but the direction of travel seems pretty clear.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 0, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pp2yn4/looks_like_crypto_repeats_the_same_cycle_price/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Gaining consensus is priority number one. That is hard because OGs don't like the term \"freeze.\" The proposal isn't writing rules to freeze particular keys, it is preventing use of signatures that are unsecure. So all holders would be given time to transition to private keys that are secure against post quantum capabilities.  I think Lopp frames the right questions and counterpoints. \n\nI've raised my thoughts on this as well and posted some ideas on how to transition.  I actually agree it doesn't make sense to leave open a method where quantum computing can steal keys.\n\nClosing that gap may come at the expense of some that fail to ever transition, but if they've been given years to transition, there isn't a strong argument that it isn't fair.  Securing the chain needs to happen.\n\nI've followed the quantum resistant coin category for a long time as a holder of Qanplatform.\n\nWhile many of the projects in the space talk about how they hope to capitalize from users seeking assets already prepared, I still view that as a long shot play.  Which is why most have moved toward building utilty chains. \n\nI think there is a large market incoming as all systems will be making upgrades.  Combining cryptography transition methods and blockchain utility will offer solutions enterprises want.  And they don't have the same decentralized challenges to overcome.  They can start implementing now, and we are seeing that happen.\n\nGlad to see the shift where nearly all coins are working on their approach.

Not tax advice. Talk to your own tax professional about your specific situation. Specific to the USA.***\n\nYear-end is approaching and the window to make powerful tax plays for the 2025 tax year is closing fast.\n\nI’m a CPA with a deep background in crypto tax (formerly helped build a client-facing crypto service firm as GM, now leveraging that experience to build robust crypto tax software as Product Lead at Summ (formerly Crypto Tax Calculator)).\n\nI see the same confusion every year, so I wanted to share some high-level, educational context around tax loss harvesting that may be useful as people review their 2025 activity.\n\n# What is Tax Loss Harvesting?\n\nTax loss harvesting is the act of intentionally selling an asset that has gone down in value from your initial purchase in order to \"realize\" the loss for tax purposes.\n\nBy selling/swapping at a loss (as opposed to simply holding), you trigger a tax loss that can be used to directly offset any capital gains, or even ordinary income (up to $3k, the rest is carried forward).\n\nThe key point: losses don’t exist for tax purposes until they’re realized. Simply holding an underwater asset doesn’t create a deductible loss.\n\n***How does it work?***\n\nA simplified example:\n\nIf that losing position is disposed of before year-end, the loss can reduce the net taxable capital gain. If it isn’t, the unrealized loss provides no tax benefit that year.\n\nI see a lot of traders hold onto losers “just in case,” then get surprised by a larger-than-expected tax bill because those losses were never realized.\n\n*PS -- dead memecoins and NFTs are a tax loss harvesting goldmine.*\n\nSimply put, if I have a $50,000 capital gain from selling ETH at profit (or any crypto, stock, or real estate), but am sitting on a $22,000 unrealized loss from a bad memecoin trade, I could dispose of that asset to reduce my taxable capital gains from $50,000 --&gt; $28,000.\n\n*The catch?*\n\nThis disposal needs to happen **BEFORE YEAR END** in order for it to count for your next tax return.\n\n# Why is this current market a particularly good opportunity (and risk)?\n\nIn general, the crypto market has seen a significant increase in value throughout 2025. Bitcoin has climbed 30+% at times, ETH climbing over 150%+ at times etc.\n\nEach crypto-to-crypto swap is taxable. And in rising market, without realizing it, many people have likely triggered taxable gains as they swapped crypto throughout the year.\n\nBut here at year end, markets are generally down from the highs we saw just a few months ago ($125k BTC --&gt; $90k).\n\nThis means that many people are likely sitting on ***unrealized*** losses while simultaneously sitting on capital gains they will need to pay tax on.\n\nI've seen this trope far too many times.\n\n\\--&gt; Flip gains throughout the year\n\n\\--&gt; positions are underwater by year end\n\n\\--&gt; but they still owe the full amount of tax on the gains because they never realized their losses.\n\nFor those who are prepared, this is a *golden opportunity* to pull this lever and directly reduce their tax bill. For those unprepared, they'll be paying far more tax than they need to all because they failed to properly tax plan and consider end-of-year tax strategy.\n\n# Can I rebuy after I sell?\n\nThe short answer is, yes, you can rebuy. This question stems from the fact that with securities, the \"wash sale rule\" requires you wait 30 days before you can rebuy, otherwise, the loss doesn't count. However, with crypto, this is not the case.\n\nThe IRS classifies crypto as property, not a security, see [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). The wash loss sale rule specifically applies only to securities, not property, see [here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/glossary.jsp?term=wash%20sale). Thus, wash loss sale rule is not applicable for crypto (yet).\n\nThis means you could sell your crypto that's underwater, and then decide to rebuy the same crypto without needing to wait the full 30 days.\n\nIn other words, going to my prior example, someone could sell their losing assets and realize the $22,000 loss, and then later rebuy the same amount of those assets back. The end result? They still realize the loss, and still hold the assets in hopes they go back up.\n\n**There is a caveat here**: While the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto, the \"Economic Substance Doctrine\" does.\n\n**What is the Economic Substance Doctrine (\"ESD\")?**\n\nThe ESD is the IRS's magic wand they can waive to disallow a loss they deem to \"not have economic substance\". In other words, if you're in an audit and the IRS determines a loss is a result of a transaction that did not have any economic substance (ie selling and rebuying *immediately* for the SOLE purpose of finessing a tax loss), then they *might* disallow the loss.\n\nThis means it is best practice to make these transactions with additional goals in mind. e.g., maybe you'd like to rebalance your portfolio so you sell down your losing positions to stop the bleeding and then independently decide which assets you'd like to be exposed to moving forward.\n\nThe takeaway here is that while the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto, that doesn't mean the IRS can't disallow the loss if they determine the transaction didn't have economic substance.\n\n# What is the best way to know which of my assets to sell?\n\nTo evaluate harvesting opportunities, you'll need your detailed transaction history and cost basis by lot (not average)\n\nFor the insane people out there, some do this by Excel. Jokes aside, this is a feasible option for anyone who has fairly simple activity such as just a few trades a year on a single exchange.\n\nFor those who want a more automated process or have a more complicated transaction history (multiple exchanges/wallets, more than a dozen trades a year etc), most rely on a crypto tax calculator. Coming from the service-provider space, we only used software as excel just doesn't cut it in most cases.\n\nFor software, there are a few options out there to chose from, but I personally use Summ for mine (obviously!). That said, I always recommend trying a few and seeing which works best for you. Don't just pick one because someone online likes it, try em out yourself!\n\n***Determining opportunities:***\n\nOnce you've loaded your data into your software of choice, make sure you're transaction history looks complete and accurate. If the software offers a tax loss harvesting feature, then you can use that for your investigation. But if your software doesn't offer that feature, one super easy way to do some testing is to simply create manual transactions *simulating* sales to see what the tax impact is. From here, you can dig even deeper by looking at the tax lots being disposed.\n\nFor example, maybe I simulate the sale of 1 BTC and it comes back with an ***overall*** $2k loss. But, I can drill down even further.\n\nWhen I look at the tax lots being disposed, I can see that the 1 BTC sale might be made up of 3 different tax lots. Maybe two of them are resulting in a loss of $1,500 and $4,500 respectively, and the third tax lot is resulting in a gain of $4,000, making the overall sale a $2,000 net loss.\n\nWith this info, now I know I don't need to sell the whole 1 BTC, but instead can just sell the partial amounts that makes up the two tax lots that would result in a total of $6,000 loss, which is even more powerful then selling the full 1 BTC.\n\nBy doing this, I am only selling the BTC tax lots that result in a loss while leaving the tax lot with an unrealized gain in place.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAs a CPA, I am CONSTANTLY asked how to reduce tax. This is truly one of the most powerful levers a taxpayer can pull in order to reduce their bill to Uncle Sam.\n\nIf anyone has any questions or commentary on the topic, feel free to drop them below. Per usual, always consult with your own tax professional for tax advice specific to you. Cheers, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!\n\n\\- JustinCPA, Product Lead @ Summ", "lang": null, "likes": 31, "replies": 22, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1poi6e5/tax_loss_harvesting_serious/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Powell’s basically saying the Fed is “well positioned to wait and see” and that policy should help the labor market stabilize...he even said it might only tick up one or two more tenths rather than roll over hard. Also important: he said they haven’t made any decision about January.\n\nThe interesting part here is futures markets briefly priced in about a 31% chance of a January cut after the jobs data (then it cooled a bit). Looking further out, the market is still leaning toward roughly two cuts during 2026.\n\nFor crypto this is kinda mixed signals. Lower rates usually mean more money flowing into riskier assets like Bitcoin and ETH because traditional savings become less attractive.

I think a lot of people are still sleeping on what's happening with crypto in LATAM - especially Buenos Aires.\n\nIf you actually follow the scene there, it has become insanely active in 2025. Buenos Aires hosted Devconnect Argentina in November 2025, billed as an \"Ethereum World's Fair\" with thousands of builders, creators and devs flying in from around the world. That basically turned the city into a global hub for real crypto development and collaboration, not just another conference stop.\n\nBefore that, Merge Buenos Aires ran in March 2025, bringing together Web3 leaders and communities from Europe and the Americas for panels, talks and networking. And earlier before that, the Aleph Crecimiento Pop-Up City event ran through much of March, turning parts of the city into collaborative, builder-centric spaces for several weeks.\n\nAll of this isn't happening by accident. Argentina already has one of the highest real-world crypto adoption rates in the world, thanks in part to people using stablecoins and digital assets as everyday payment and savings tools in an inflation-heavy economy. That gives the city something most \"crypto hubs\" only wish they had: actual usage, not just conference vanity. \n\nNow add in moves like Nexo acquiring Buenbit and making Buenos Aires its LATAM regional hub - and you start to see the real picture. That's a global platform positioning itself directly in the markets where people live and breathe crypto, at a time when infrastructure and talent are both exploding. They’re bringing institutional-grade security, yield products and credit tools that people here actually need - think of it as private crypto banking rooted in real adoption. \n\nWhat makes this interesting is how different it feels from past cycles. This is builders, users, regulators and platforms all pointing toward the same direction at once. The region is already showing its own cycles and liquidity patterns that don't always match the U.S. or EU - and big companies are now betting on that. \n\nSo yeah - while the world debates narratives, LATAM is producing results. If this trajectory holds, the next global crypto capital won't be New York or Singapore. It'll be Buenos Aires - and 2026 might be the year the world finally has to admit it.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 3, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pneecc/is_buenos_aires_quietly_becoming_the_next_global/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Someone posted a chart showing BTC crashing to $3 if that happened and sold off Satoshi's million coins.\n\nWilly Woo jumped in saying that old school Bitcoin holders would actually buy that flash crash. His point is that the Bitcoin network itself would survive because most coins today aren’t “instantly exposed” to a quantum attack in the same way the oldest ones are (especially if you’re not reusing addresses).\n\nHeres the issue tho. The numbers vary depending on how people count it, but it’s definitely “millions of BTC” that are more exposed. Some of it sits in really old formats like P2PK, and a bigger chunk is coins tied to reused addresses / situations where the public key is already known. Satoshi’s stash is part of that whole “very old coins” conversation people keep bringing up.\n\nAdam Back who's been around since Bitcoin's early days says we dont need to worry for like 20-40 years. He thinks theres plenty of time to upgrade everyone to quantum-resistant security before any real threat emerges. Standards for quantum-proof encryption already exist apparently.\n\nThe intresting part is that analyst James Check says the real risk isnt the technology itself but the market panic. He says theres \"no chance\" the Bitcoin community would agree to freeze Satoshi's coins before they get hacked, so if it happens we'd see massive selling pressure.\n\nalso, if panic trading actually hits, the boring stuff becomes painful fast. people will swap a ton, move coins around, maybe jump chains. and then months later you’re trying to untangle what you did. tools like awaken.tax are basically for that exact mess, just keeping cost basis and reports clean when things get chaotic.\n\nPersonally I think if quantum computers advanced that fast we'd have bigger problems than Bitcoin prices lol.

Cypherpunks, crypto bros, red pills, finfluencers, and other fantastic creatures sold a dream to the average dreamer: financial freedom, enhanced privacy, the end of monetary tyranny. Over the past decade, a romantic narrative captured libertarians and anarchists with the force of a gospel: Bitcoin (and other cryptos) would be the final refuge from the State. Unseizable money. Pseudonymity. The perfect tool to escape the tax-hungry frenzy of governments that treat citizens like taxable cattle—and from the parasitic banking system.\n\nWhat Amazon delivered to our doorstep was an omniscient, omnipresent surveillance system that charges transaction fees for the privilege of feeding it.\n\nMost users operate under the illusion of “pseudonymous anonymity.” There’s no name or Social Security number in the block explorer, therefore we’re protected. That’s only true in a world without external context.\n\nBitcoin is an immutable ledger. Every unit carries its entire history. Unlike cash—which has no memory—Bitcoin remembers. Always. This isn’t an accidental flaw; it’s the heart of the system.\n\nWhen funds leave a KYC exchange and arrive in a self-custodied wallet, the link is established. No need to break cryptography. Graph analysis does the rest. Identifiable entry points make the system retrospectively transparent.\n\nThis is structural. Even with perfect opsec, a public blockchain remains an eternal database.\n\nIt’s important to distinguish: possibility is not inevitability. States aren’t omniscient, nor do they have infinite resources. Jurisdictions vary. Priorities change.\n\nBut modern surveillance doesn’t work case by case. It works by accumulating data and applying it selectively later. An irrelevant event today can become incriminating tomorrow. The evidence doesn’t decay. It doesn’t technically expire. It just waits for sufficient interest.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t guarantee persecution. It guarantees retroactive auditability. That’s already a lot.\n\n“Fine,” you say, adjusting your metaphorical hoodie, “then I’ll use Monero. Its blockchain is opaque.”\n\nAnd here things get more interesting—and sadder.\n\nMonero’s cryptography is genuinely robust. Ring signatures, stealth addresses, obfuscated amounts. Direct transaction tracing is genuinely hard. But you, dear anon, may be the weak link. In modern forensic accounting, when we can’t follow the money, we follow the device. Or behavioral patterns. Or both.\n\nUsing a privacy coin on a regular computer is like locking the safe and leaving the key under the doormat.\n\nYour IP address: if you access your bank and your Monero wallet from the same home Wi-Fi without Tor or a decent VPN, your ISP can correlate the data. It depends on cooperation and analysis, but the possibility exists—and possibilities have a habit of materializing when there’s enough state interest.\n\nYour phone’s MAC address: if you installed a KYC exchange app on the same device you use to access anonymous accounts, the device chassis becomes your fingerprint. Dedicated devices mitigate this. Most people don’t use dedicated devices.\n\nCanvas fingerprinting: websites silently ask your browser to draw an invisible image. Micro-variations in your GPU make that drawing unique like a fingerprint. Visit a regulated site and then an anonymous market in the same browser without blockers, and the hash identifies you—VPN or not. This isn’t Monero’s fault. It’s a structural vulnerability of the modern web.\n\nMonero offers superior on-chain privacy. Off-chain, it’s a different battle—and it requires rigorous opsec that most people don’t practice.\n\nIn trying to erase traces, many turn to mixers. Tornado Cash. CoinJoin. The promise of “cleaning” coins.\n\nFrom a forensic standpoint, you’re not necessarily cleaning the money. You’re flagging it as suspicious.\n\nBitcoin’s fungibility is a polished fiction. Compliance tools used by major exchanges—Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace—automatically label funds that passed through mixers as “High Risk” or “Potential Illicit Activity.” Especially after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, using a mixer became almost a confession.\n\nTry sending those “mixed” funds to Binance or Coinbase. The outcome is predictable: immediate freeze. The algorithm detects the mixer, locks your balance, opens a compliance case. You wanted privacy. You got radioactive money—useless in the formal economy.\n\nThere are more sophisticated strategies, specific contexts where mixers work. But for the average user, trying to hide often makes things worse.\n\nWhat about instant swaps? Offshore exchanges that promise no documents?\n\nSome work. For now. But they carry a risk few properly calculate: in the worst case, they’re honeypots. Traps run or infiltrated by the very people you’re trying to avoid.\n\nThese companies live in gray zones. Their survival depends on the tolerance—explicit or tacit—of global authorities. Many adopt quiet compliance to avoid shutdown. The risk trigger works like this: if incoming funds look suspicious, the system freezes the deposit and demands a passport to release it. You enter anonymous. You leave forcibly identified.\n\nEven platforms that don’t ask for a name at entry log IP, timestamp, transaction hash. When Interpol or the tax authority sends a subpoena, many “libertarian” exchanges hand over the logs immediately. It depends on jurisdiction, pressure, and the cost-benefit of resisting.\n\nThe platform promising anonymity today may be compelled—or simply decide—to cooperate tomorrow.\n\nThe forums’ favorite excuse: “I’ll say I was hacked. That I lost the private key in a boating accident.”\n\nThe State doesn’t play only by the rules of cryptography. It uses net worth analysis.\n\nIf you claim to have lost your crypto fortune but the following year buy property in cash, the tax authority applies the net worth method. Where did that money come from? A judge can reverse the burden of proof: prove lawful origin. If you can’t—because the origin is the crypto you swore sank at sea—the situation gets ugly.\n\nThe blockchain validates the transaction. Economic reality validates intent.\n\nFor local, physical exchanges, cash is still unbeatable.\n\nFor private digital transactions, coins like Monero work—provided they’re paired with rigorous opsec, dedicated devices, and acceptance of friction.\n\nFor the average user seeking “effortless financial freedom,” Bitcoin offers something different from what was promised: permanent global traceability.\n\nNo one said it would be easy. They said it would be revolutionary. Maybe it’s both. Maybe the revolution just isn’t the one we were promised.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 19, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pm05z2/blockchain_is_the_sweetest_dream_of_state/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I just want a direct and non-custodial swap with good liquidity, quick execution, and low fees.\n\nIf anyone has done this recently, I’d appreciate any advice on what worked, what didn’t, and what I should avoid. I want the process to stay as straightforward and secure as possible.", "lang": null, "likes": 208, "replies": 43, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pl76ft/where_to_swap_bitcoin_for_usdt/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nAlso, the second you *do* recover something like this, there’s a whole “ok now what” layer people forget. Cost basis, old exchange records, DeFi trails, what’s taxable vs what’s just a transfer. That part isn’t fun, but it’s real. Stuff like Awaken tax exists basically for that exact cleanup when your history is chaotic and you don’t want to guess and overpay.  \n  \nIts kinda funny but also dark when you think about how much wealth is permanently locked away because people forgot passwords or lost hardware. This movie will probably give everyone watching anxiety about their own crypto storage.\n\nWill definately watch this just to see how they handle the technical aspects and whether they make it accurate or go full Hollywood nonsense.", "lang": null, "likes": 18, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pkzwn8/netflix_is_making_a_comedy_movie_about_a_couple/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Not to mention the slew of problems materializing and present in traditional fiat finance.\n\nI made some money, and thought I would be a forever holder.

Eventually leading to the sale of all of my cryptocurrency due to the belief that the layman would never be savvy enough to store their own keys, and centralized layer 2 was just reinventing the traditional finance system, but with less consumer protections.\n\nFast forward to today, a hobby miner caught my interest and reignited my passion for crypto.\n\nSo here I am, trying to convince myself to get back into cryptocurrency.

I logged every explicit prediction they made — price targets, time horizons, cycle calls, macro takes — and tracked whether those predictions actually came true.\n\nI began this as a personal project to bring accountability, but also to test whether structured prediction data from YouTube creators contains any measurable **predictive power** when aggregated or analyzed over time.\n\nAt first I did everything manually, but as the workload grew I built a simple internal tool to help organize transcripts, extract predictions, and manage labeling. *(Screenshot in post.)*\n\n\n\n# What I measured\n\nFor each prediction, I currently log:\n\n• the exact claim  \n• the timeframe  \n• the outcome\n\n**One thing I’m adding next is a “prediction difficulty” score (baseline probability).** I haven’t finished labeling this yet, but it matters — some predictions are trivial (“BTC will be higher in 12 months”), while others are extremely low-probability. Raw accuracy alone can be misleading without this adjustment.\n\nThis should help distinguish creators who show real skill from those who primarily make safe predictions that tend to happen anyway.\n\n\n\n# Early results (raw accuracy only — baseline coming next):\n\n# 1.

My previous post, “[Altcoin Season Is Canceled](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pr0d56/altseason_is_canceled_forever)” got 240K views. Clearly, many people are wondering what is happening with altcoins and what their future looks like.\n\nMost commentators debated whether we actually had an altcoin season at all. One user, u/MaximumStudent1839, identified my pain point and argued that the whole \"ownership\", \"equity\", and \"cash flow\" was misleading and \"brain hemorrhage\". His view was simple: tokens should be treated as store-of-value assets driven purely by consensus. No future cash flows, no fee growth, no usage-based valuation. Just owning tokens based on their role and necessity within a given blockchain. Bullish on network-effect assets and bearish on some DeFi tokens, \"ICM\" tokens, etc.\n\nIn that framing, crypto is not a security, registered or unregistered. It is a collectible, sometimes with utility tied to an adjacent protocol.\n\nWhile I was responding to comments, Stani, the founder of Aave landing protocol, was effectively demonstrating how this theory plays out in practice.\n\nI made a video braking down how AAVE DAO debacle unfolded [https://youtu.be/NLDFTqavmNA](https://youtu.be/NLDFTqavmNA) and how Gary Gensler might have been right.\n\nThe moment the SEC dropped its investigation early Dec '25, Aave Labs switched the swap provider on its frontend and redirected fees away from the DAO. The amount is not huge - $10m, roughly one ninth of total Aave fees. Still, the principle matters. AAVE token holders do not benefit if fees accrue anywhere outside the DAO treasury.\n\nThis raised a key question. Should the DAO control all Aave IP and all fees generated by its storefront? Some may think this is not very important, but what if storefront fees eventually exceed protocol fees? AAVE holders should care where value is created and where it flows.\n\nThe vote happened, and Stani voted against the initiative, carrying about 33% of the voting power. Days before the vote, he spent roughly $12M buying AAVE. Good for price, bad for decentralization. Other large holders abstained. And realistically, why would they vote against the founder? He is responsible for their gains and has the most skin in the game.\n\nNow consider the real risk. What if tomorrow there is a decision to funnel protocol fees to another wallet and cut off the DAO entirely? Would the minority be able to unite and vote against it?\n\nDAOs are a compelling idea, but in practice the founding team has the final say. If they decide to sell the labs, as we saw with Axelar, Padre, and Tensor, token holders have no real way to intervene.\n\nSo you can throw most of the decentralization and governance narrative out the window. It does not work in the real world. Like communism, it sounds good on paper. When trying to make everyone equal - someone will always be more equal than others.\n\nTo be precise, it does work, just not the way it is advertised. DAOs simplify corporate governance, make it transparent, and put voting onchain. But they only cover the technical layer of governance, not ownership or control.\n\nAt the end of the day, crypto tokens function like unregistered securities. The best outcome we can realistically hope for is that the current SEC administration under Paul Atkins carves out a niche with more relaxed rules for digital securities.\n\nThat would simplify development and further integrate TradFi. At the same time, it would likely compress valuations, as criminal and scam capital would be forced out toward privacy chains that even most DEXs do not support.\n\nForget about altcoin season. Forget about “the next cycle.” Pumps will still happen, but only for a select few, mostly new tokens with the right timing, the right narrative, heavy marketing budgets, and VC or cabal bundling. Do not hold, and definitely do not DCA into any project tokens.\n\n2024–25 taught me that, in the long run, capital preservation matters more than capital growth. In 2026, I’m bullish on L1/L2 ecosystems and platform tokens with strong network effects, and bearish on most project coins.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year.", "lang": null, "likes": 89, "replies": 53, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pwhabi/aave_just_killed_decentralization_2026_outlook/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Hello everyone!\nI recently stumbled across this article about WeFi being named the most innovative Web3 project: https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/12/16/wefi-name-most-innovative-web3-project/\nI'm genuinely curious about what the community thinks of this project because something feels off to me, though I can't quite put my finger on it.\nFrom what I can gather, they've been running a massive marketing campaign that seems specifically designed to attract newcomers to crypto. On one hand, bringing fresh blood into the space is always good for adoption. On the other hand, projects that focus heavily on marketing rather than technology often raise red flags for me.\nHere's my main concern: I've read through their materials and I still don't fully understand what problem they're actually solving or what their core value proposition is. The website has a lot of buzzwords and promises, but the actual utility seems vague. Is it a DeFi platform? An infrastructure project? It's not entirely clear to me.\nI'm also wondering if this is genuinely innovative or just repackaging existing concepts with slicker marketing. The crypto space has seen plenty of projects that generate a lot of noise but don't contribute anything meaningful to the ecosystem.\nHas anyone here actually used WeFi or dug deep into their whitepaper?\nDoes their technology stack make sense, or is it mostly vaporware?\nAre there any red flags I should be aware of?\nIs this actually innovative, or just good at PR?\nI want to keep an open mind, but I'm naturally skeptical of projects that seem to prioritize marketing over substance. Would love to hear both positive and critical takes from people who've done their research.\nThanks in advance for any insights!", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1prk84q/what_do_we_think_about_wefi_and_deobank/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

This sub isn’t very fond of memecoins, but there are a few of us here.  \nWe are now in the 3rd memecoin winter, and after the Oct 10 lows, we’re picking up steam again, with more tokens deployed, more graduating, and higher volume. Tokenized communities end up being stickers then jpegs.   \n(attaching some ss at the end)\n\nEveryone talks about 10000x and pnl ss, but very few talk about survival. After trading memecoins for over two years, one thing has become painfully clear to me: capital preservation is the real edge, not finding the next 67.\n\nPersonally, I started with roughly 40 sol but stuck to 5% risk per trade (2 sol per trade). While making a tutorial on memecoin trading, I debated what the absolute minimum is to survive in the trenches.\n\nBesides ruggers, drainers, and extractors, memecoin trading has a lot of taxes that compound. It’s not just buy and hope. Every trade is taxed by reality. You pay trading fees, terminal fees, priority fees, bribes, failed transactions, slippage, and opportunity cost. All of that adds up very quickly. When learning and starting with only 10 sol (\\~$1.3k), traders often forget to adjust their axiom buy/sell filters, and fees eat their sol.\n\nOver time, it becomes obvious that undercapitalization is the number one reason people fail. Trading with tiny size forces you into bad decisions. You chase harder, hold longer, and gamble more because the math no longer works. That’s why I believe 10 sol is the minimum threshold to trade memecoins seriously. If you don’t have 10 sol that you’re fully prepared to lose, you probably shouldn’t be trading memecoins at all.\n\nWith 10 sol, trading 0.2 sol per trade makes sense. That’s roughly 2% risk per trade. You can get rugged 50 times straight. You can learn how narratives move, how liquidity behaves, and how social signals evolve without blowing up your stack in a single afternoon. Survival gives you time, and time is the only thing that compounds in this market.\n\nSome KOLs advise against such small numbers and say to get a job instead. No comments. Others say they grew small stacks into meaningful ones. Maybe they did. But the real question is whether that’s repeatable without pure luck. Is it realistic to grow from very small size once fees and bribes are factored in?\n\nI’m curious where others land on this. We aren’t getting many $10m mooners these days. Is 10 sol truly enough to learn the ropes? Is 0.2 sol the right position size once all costs are considered? And more importantly, should capital preservation be the primary goal in memecoin trading, or is that mindset incompatible with the market itself?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nState of memecoins in Dec 2025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/957mwhgvvn7g1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa2794448bddf2790c3755ccf8e680108f2b8f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcgppggvvn7g1.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dbf44966caa39f8d15399bd5f416e10583e83cd", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1poivbd/meme_coin_traders_is_02_sol_per_trade_enough/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Kwon pleaded guilty in August and took responsibility. He wrote to the court saying he was responsible for the pain people went through and that he led the community astray in his hubris.\n\nSBF on the other hand went to trial and maintained his innocence throughout. He claimed FTX just had a liquidity crisis not actual fraud. The judge also called him evasive, found perjury, and cited witness tampering.\n\nAnother factor is what happens next.

This continues their strong support for r/CryptoCurrency and our community rewards program.\n\n• u/jwinterm has soft-launched the new community hub website: rcryptocurrency.com. This site will replace and significantly expand upon the current ccmoons.com functionality.  \nCurrent features include viewing token KPIs (holders, earners, price, supply), subreddit statistics, karma estimators, Moon history, integrated Uniswap trading, and more functionality coming soon.\n\n# 2. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/) &amp; [https://rcryptocurrency.com/](https://rcryptocurrency.com/)  \nNew Community Hub (soft launch): [https://rcryptocurrency.com](https://rcryptocurrency.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance (Snapshot): [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nAdvertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 3. Treasury Overview (as of December 8, 2025)\n\nAsset balances and valuations:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,190|$42,885|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,619|\n|USDC|2,080|$2,080|\n|USDT|1,366|$1,366|\n|USDC.E|$487|$487|\n|ARB|1,848|$393|\n\nTotal non-Moon value: $6,945  \nChange since last update: -$ 5,223\n\nStablecoin value (USDC + USDT + USDC.E): $3,933  \nPrevious stablecoin total: $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins: -$4,681\n\nThe largest expense was $6,100 USDC for MIDAO legal registration, sent directly to MIDAO.\n\nThe DAO added \\~$1400 in stablecoins, excluding the MIDAO payment.\n\n# 4. Burn Summary\n\nNew burn totals:\n\nArbitrum Nova: 3,197,609  \nArbitrum One: 1,038,816  \nTotal burned: 4,236,425 Moons\n\nPrevious totals (November 9):  \nNova: 3,189,800  \nOne: 1,038,094  \nTotal: 4,227,894\n\nChanges since last update:  \n• Nova burn increase: 7,809 (driven mostly by Kraken’s AMA event)  \n• Arbitrum One burn increase: 722  \n• Combined burn increase: 8,531 Moons\n\nBurns on Arbitrum One remain low as incoming revenue is being used to compensate for Kraken’s pure burn, per the transparency report.\n\n# 5. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DoL)\n\nThe DAO currently maintains one liquidity pool position.\n\nCurrent composition:  \n• 93,100.95 Moons  \n• 284.62 USDC\n\nValue breakdown:  \n• Moon value: $4,839  \n• USDC value: $284.62  \n• Total DoL value: $5,124.52\n\nThis is lower than last month due to Moon price moving from approximately $0.0634 to $0.0519.\n\nThe low USDC proportion reflects the fact that as sponsor revenue enters the DAO, market conditions have pushed Moon’s price downward, causing the pool to accumulate more Moons and less USDC. This is functioning effectively as automatic buy pressure, allowing sellers to exit into deep liquidity while the DAO accumulates Moons cheaply.\n\nAs additional revenue arrives, we will continue rebalancing the pool and shifting toward a 50–50 asset split. If Moon’s price rises, the balance will naturally adjust.\n\n# 6. Distribution Update\n\nPolygon Labs is sponsoring $5,000 in POL tokens for creator rewards. Subreddit users will receive 32,000 POL tokens.\n\nFor Moon Week 69, the DAO will distribute 7,440 Moons.  \nDuring Moon Epoch 69, the distribution wallet received 7,441 Moons.\n\nThe Community Currency App has continued to experience occasional technical issues. If the claim interface is down, users may use manual withdraw commands. We encourage anyone with issues to ask for help.\n\nLong-term, the plan is to migrate claims to [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com), where users will be able to claim rewards directly from our website without relying on the external app.\n\nSince the last update, three projects held AMAs:  \n• Kraken  \n• Stellar  \n• Space Computer\n\nThis is a normal slowdown for year-end in crypto, as many teams pause marketing during holiday periods and uncertain market conditions.\n\n# 7. Governance Update\n\nThere were no governance proposals this round.\n\nHowever, one user has applied for the vacant Ecosystem Growth Officer position. This nomination will go live as a formal governance vote once the MIDAO legal proposal cycle completes.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe primary focus remains on completing the transition to the new [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com) platform. This website will serve as the central community hub outside Reddit, offering dashboards, analytics, creator reward claiming, advertiser onboarding, and a wide range of community tools.\n\nDeFi integrations will continue to expand, including additional liquidity management and possible new partner protocols.\n\nI am actively working on a bridge contract with support from u/jwinterm. Our goal is to integrate bridging directly into [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com), allowing users to move Moons seamlessly between Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nWe also hope to host a Moon livestream (MOON Stream) later this month to review everything the DAO accomplished in 2025, share the status of MIDAO recognition, and outline 2026 goals.", "lang": null, "likes": 21, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1phptu0/ccmoon_dao_update_december_8_2025_moon_week_69/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Most newer and modern blockchains use a mix of soft and hard forks for updates. Older blockchains often soft fork to maintain backwards compatibility with old and insecure client versions.\n\nBy definition, a hard fork is an update or event that will result in a chain split if block producers and node clients continue using different versions.\n\n####**Soft Forks result in code bloat, dangerous practices, and technical debt**:\n\nSoft forks maintain backwards compatibility with older clients, so they need to add additional code logic to detect and deal with all the different types of clients they might encounter. This creates developer complexity and code bloat by continuously supporting archaic and dangerous practices.\n\n**Imagine what would happen without hard-forks**:\n\n* Newer WiFi routers would still support the insecure WEP or WPA protocol\n* Browser would still support old, insecure versions of SSL\n* Newer computers would still support Windows 3.0 (launched 1990) natively\n* Windows 11 would still support early 1990s Intel 386-generation hardware.\n* All city roads would still allow for horses and wagons.\n* All US stores would still accept 3-cent, 5-cent and 10-cent paper notes; and half-cent, 2-cent, and 3-cent, and large cents; and $100,000 bills.\n* Doctors would still support dangerous practices such as bloodletting, mercury prescriptions, arsenic prescriptions, and trepanning (drilling holes into skulls)\n\nIt's dangerous to never hard fork.\n\n####**Bitcoin soft forks results in complexity and update delays**\n\nBitcoin still supports many outdated legacy addresses such as P2PK, P2MS, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKSH, P2WSH. Each of these has their own special quirks, and every Bitcoin client needs to add additional complexity to support them. Many of these aren't quantum secure and should be prevented from transferring in the future, which requires a hard fork.\n\nBitcoin nodes also take forever to update to a new version. It wasn't until mid-2024 that most clients supported transferring to Bech32m addresses that were introduced in May 2021. Taproot, which requires Bech32m support, also took nearly half a decade to obtain significant client support. That's because unlike with hard forks, Bitcoin nodes aren't required to support the latest features. So it takes the Bitcoin network half a decade to pick up new features.\n\n####**Bitcoin has hard-forked at least twice, and that's perfectly fine**\n\nLastly, contrary to popular opinion, Bitcoin's canonical chain has actually hard forked at least twice unintentionally.\n\n1. There was a temporary 0.8 update related to the 2013 reorg (where a 51% attack and double-spend also occurred). Had the update been planned as a hard fork instead of soft fork, there wouldn't have been a disastrous chain split.\n2. The 0.3.6 OP_NOP update also resulted in a hard fork a year later when the first OP_NOPX transaction was submitted in block 163685.\n\nPre-0.3.6 Bitcoin clients no longer sync with newer versions due to a hard fork, and that's not a bad thing. No one should be running archaic versions of Bitcoin client.\n\nJameson Lopp discovered that 7 out of 21 known Bitcoin consensus updates were of the hard fork type and not the soft fork type. They could've been triggered by a \"poisoned\" transaction like in the November 2025 Cardano chain split, but no one ever submitted one for 5 of them. These include Bitcoin 0.2's best chain selection logic, Bitcoin OP_VER update prior to 0.3.6, the scriptSig bug patched in v0.3.7, the critical inflation bug patched in v0.15.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1paox12/opinion_hard_forks_are_necessary_for_eliminating/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Back then it was normal to see 15–20% APY and not ask too many questions. Now whenever I see double digits, my first thought is: *“what exactly is going to blow up to pay for this?”*  \n  \nFor me it kind of breaks down into three buckets: DeFi, sketchy CeFi, and the more regulated CeFi stuff.  \n  \nDeFi first. Yields are back on things like Curve, Pendle, Aave, etc., and if you know what you’re doing, there are still some really nice plays there. But nothing about the underlying risks has changed: smart contract exposure, exploits, governance drama, incentives that vanish the moment emissions run out. I’m happy to put part of my stack in DeFi, but I’m not pretending it’s “safe yield.” It’s still, “this might be fine, or this might be a lessons-learned post in three months.”  \n  \nThen you’ve got the classic offshore “trust me bro” platforms. The ones offering flashy APYs with zero transparency, vague T&amp;Cs, and some office somewhere you’d never actually visit. I used to dabble in those. Now? Hard pass. Too many stories where withdrawals get “temporarily paused” until everyone’s wiped out.  \n  \nThe last bucket is the more boring, regulated CeFi side. Think Nеxo, Gemini, and a couple of others. Actual licensing, audits, collateral frameworks - and at least a clear idea of where the yield comes from. The rates aren’t wild anymore, but the whole appeal is that it’s supposed to be boring.  \n  \nNеxo is the one I’ve ended up using for the stable part of my stack. After trying pretty much everything, a few things stood out. They’ve been operating for years without a single hack, which is rare in this industry. They’re properly licensed and supervised in multiple jurisdictions, not just “registered somewhere.” And their support is true 24/7 - when something feels off, you get a human, not a bot that replies three days later.  \n  \nRates for stables sit in that mid to high single-digit range depending on loyalty tier and setup. Nothing crazy, but consistent, transparent, and without lock-ins or gimmicks. For me that’s the point - if I wanted stress, I’d be farming on some new L2 with 14 audits and still pray nothing gets drained.  \n  \nOne thing I didn’t expect to use as much is their card. Being able to keep most of my liquidity in stablecoins, spend directly from that balance, and earn cashback without dealing with off-ramps or bank delays makes everyday spending a lot smoother. It’s closer to how crypto should feel: fluid and instant.  \n  \nNone of this is “go all in on X.” There’s no such thing as fully safe yield - just a spectrum from “this might get exploited tomorrow” to “this has a track record, regulation, and structure behind it.” But in 2025, I’d rather have fewer surprises and slightly lower APY than roll the dice for a few extra percent.  \n  \nCurious how everyone else is handling it now that stablecoins are moving again. Where are you parking your stables these days if the goal is consistency rather than degeneracy?", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 30, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p86ctm/stablecoin_volumes_are_heating_up_again_and_im/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Aptos is leading the pack with an insane 0.08s, followed closely by Somnia (0.1s) and Sui (0.24s).\n\nL2s vs. High-Performance L1s: It's interesting to see Arbitrum (0.25s) sitting right up there with the parallelized L1s like Sui and Solana.\n\nSolana: Sitting at 0.4s, which is standard for them, but technically slower than the top 5 in this specific metric.\n\nThe 2-Second Standard: Chains like Base, Optimism, and Polygon are consistent at 2s. While reliable, the gap between 0.08s and 2s is becoming noticeable in high-frequency trading or gaming use cases.\n\nDoes block time matter to you as a user, or do you only care about finality and fees?

For lots of members of r/cryptocurrency your vault was likely your first steps into DEFI. For those with MOONs who never wrote down their seed phrase or never got your vault off Reddit.

If yes continue to steps below, If no you don't have Moons in your vault you can ignore this.\n\n**Not sure if you have Moons in your vault heres what you need to do:**\n\nStep 1: Access your vault - by clicking on your profile picture and then scrolling down to vault on Iphone and the old android app\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icd3o11w8f3g1.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f51e5c3908d90df094d2ab7e8d5aab05aa8d1f3\n\nOn the newest android app click on resources -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46knplbf9f3g1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a018735e1c35a97a0df5b7a9e3bb73c0ceb79e07\n\nIf you do not see the vault icon it means you do not have any \"NFTs\" on Reddit, as such you most likely don't have any Moons. Reddit was giving away free NFTs while they were doing Moon distributions so if you don't see the vault you most likely do not have any Moons.\n\n\\---\n\nStep 2: Once you click on the vault, click the setting Icon\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oynysihy9f3g1.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=117ec60e4da68b82ccef0a2bee524fd29bfd6dec\n\nAfter you click the setting Icon you can see your public address.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9umc160af3g1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acddc361c62d1aceb604da2a500debec7876fdfc\n\nNext copy your public address (the 0x characters) into the following url:\n\n[https://nova.arbiscan.io/](https://nova.arbiscan.io/)\n\nIf you have Moons you'll see something like this under token holdings:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpmbje0qaf3g1.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21a46d39c9882107d6a55f54cec94515ff487564\n\nIf you do not have any Moons you won't have anything under Token Holdings.\n\nAssuming you have Moons you now need to go back to this settings page of the vault and reveal and write down your recovery phrase. This 12 word \"seed phrase\" is how you can access your \"Reddit Vault\" on a different device outside of Reddit.\n\nYou can get Arbitrum Nova and Moons on Metamask by following the below steps:\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/CryptoCurrency\\/comments\\/112ax9k\\/comment\\/j8j1b65](https://preview.redd.it/rcq3brenbf3g1.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a9e7ec0751e5fe4631f82dfc54a3cc4ed68268)\n\nYou don't have to get access to your Moons right away but you do need to write down and secure your seed phrase somewhere if you haven't already done it.

Ethereum basically hit the gym, cutting weight and becoming faster and smoother, all of this without sacrificing security. This is a quality of life buff for users, devs and business.\n\nAs you can see in the tweet and in the image above these are the things that Fusaka brings to the table:\n\n* **30–60% cheaper transfers** \\- sending ETH or tokens is more affordable.\n* **3–5x faster-feeling transactions** \\- not instant but close to a no wait just send vibe.\n* **NFT minting costs drop 60–70%** \\-huge for creators, platforms and anyone making drops.\n* **More stability for businesses** \\- Less spikes, smother execution and almost no downtime.\n* **Developers save 25–35% on gas** \\- This will help devs to build more and have less things to cry about xD\n\nThe final result? A better user experience for everyone, from degen traders to Web3 startups or just for people who only touch Ethereum when they mint an NFT.\n\nThis is also cool because Fusaka boosts the whole modular ecosystem without trying to replace rollups or rewrite Ethereum's roadmap.\n\nDecember 3, dont forget that date, it will probably dont affect price in the short term but it will in the long term.\n\nAre you hyped for Fusaka?\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407)", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p660rr/ethereums_fusaka_upgrade_hits_dec_3_massive_ux/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The main reason is the yield structure. Stablecoin vaults consistently return around 5–7% in-kind, and on top of that, Katana distributes KAT rewards. Even though KAT isn’t tradable yet, if it launches with around a $1 billion FDV, my current yield would be about 40% APR. Even if it opens lower, the combination of base yield and rewards still makes it the strongest setup I’ve found across DeFi.\n\nWhat stands out most to me is how Katana approaches vault curation and risk management. The team doesn’t surface every vault available. They focus on a curated set that meets their transparency and risk standards. Vaults surfaced in the Katana app and curated through Vaultbridge were completely untouched by the xUSD and Balancer events that affected other platforms. That outcome reflects how Katana designs its system rather than reacting after the fact.\n\nVaultbridge works with partners like Steakhouse, Gauntlet, and Yearn to create transparent, onchain, risk-adjusted strategies built on blue-chip collateral with conservative LTVs. Katana then channels yield from these vaults back into the network through foundation-managed liquidity and reward programs. The result is consistent, visible, and repeatable yield onchain.\n\nKatana’s structure attracts institutional partners who care about both performance and capital protection. The design of the protocol puts fund safety, transparency, and sustainable yield at the core of the chain itself.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of platforms, and Katana is the one that’s managed to align strong yield, conservative risk management, and transparent onchain strategy. That’s why I’m comfortable keeping my funds there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2txepqzvyh0g1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dc93e51a29455b384724299b4646ab409e051c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18ba6taxyh0g1.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d37e101ebf1217446fb0d4d48d7aeef79c47f78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo0hgvvxyh0g1.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ade14250a9509324971cca9a40ea07da2a364c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbaye7iyyh0g1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c788bc40680a80a131f16af15430ab416f17ab9\n\nLink to tweet that inspired this post: [https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20](https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otprn3/why_ive_stuck_with_katana_through_all_the_recent/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

You create a Twitter handle. A Discord tag. A Reddit name. A login for every exchange, wallet, and dApp. None of them talk to each other, and none of them belong to you.\n\nThis fragmentation goes beyond inconvenience. It reflects a deeper problem: in the traditional web, your identity is something you rent, not something you own.\n\nWeb3 domains change that.\n\n# The Problem With Usernames\n\nUsernames are siloed by design. They’re tied to the platform where they were created, and they can be taken away, suspended, or reassigned at any time.\n\nYou can’t transfer your identity. You can’t verify it across apps. You can’t take it with you. And if someone else grabs the name you want, it’s gone — possibly forever.\n\nMore importantly, a username is not a credential. It exists only as long as the platform allows it.\n\n# What Makes Web3 Domains Different\n\nWeb3 domains are stored in your wallet and secured by the blockchain. No one can reassign them, edit them, or suspend them. Once minted, they’re yours.\n\nThat ownership unlocks functionality usernames simply can’t match. You can use the same domain to:\n\n* Log in to dApps\n* Receive crypto payments\n* Build a unified profile\n* Send and receive onchain messages\n* Access gated communities or experiences\n\nYou don’t need to re-register. You don’t need to manage multiple identities. You don’t need to trust a platform to respect your name. The system is built to work for you.\n\n# Built for Portability\n\nWeb3 domains are designed to move with you.\n\nInstead of creating a new username every time you join a new app, your domain follows you. You can connect it to social platforms, DeFi protocols, wallets, games, marketplaces, and more.\n\nAs adoption grows, your name becomes your default identity across the Web3 ecosystem. One name. One login. One profile. Persistent and portable.\n\n# One Identity, Not a Dozen Accounts\n\nTraditional usernames force you to build a reputation in isolated bubbles. You might have one users on Reddit and another on X. None of those profiles are connected. None of them tell a complete story.\n\nWith a Web3 domain, you maintain a consistent identity across apps. You don’t have to rebuild from scratch every time you try something new. Your domain becomes your access point, your public name, and your reputation anchor — all in one.\n\nThat continuity is valuable whether you’re a creator, a collector, a builder, or someone just getting started.\n\n# What About DNS Domains?\n\nNot all domains are equal. Some DNS domains can be placed onchain, allowing them to participate in the Web3 ecosystem. But DNS domains are still subject to renewals, registrar rules, and external control.\n\nWeb3 domains are fully minted onchain and owned outright. No renewals. No middlemen. No reliance on centralized infrastructure.\n\nIf the goal is ownership, this distinction matters.\n\n# Owning Your Name Means Owning Your Identity\n\nA username identifies you only within the boundaries of the platform that issued it.\n\nA Web3 domain gives you ownership of your name across platforms, protocols, and use cases. You can log in, transact, build, and communicate without needing to rebuild your identity every time.\n\nThe internet is shifting from accounts to identity. And identity starts with a name you actually control.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otk28c/why_web3_domains_are_better_usernames/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve seen a handful of crypto companies succeed.\n\nTo succeed, many hard things must align. To fail, only one key thing needs to go wrong.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in this space, one pattern repeats itself: **the fastest path to failure is biasing toward idealism over pragmatism.**\n\nI joined the industry for its ideals. It took years - and a few hard lessons - to unlearn them.\n\n# Not About Memes or Casinos\n\nThis post is about projects trying to *create* value, not extract it. Those building new rails, not just running the same casino onchain.\n\nMemes and casinos have their own kind of Product-Market-Fit. They entertain, they speculate, they move money. But they don’t *build*. They redistribute value rather than generate it.\n\n**In short, this post is about teams growing the pie, not just grabbing the bigger slice.**\n\n*Now that the disclaimer’s out of the way, let’s get into it.*\n\n# Changing My Mind\n\nI first dipped my toes into crypto in 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on Gitter. For the past four years, I’ve been all in, building full-time.\n\nThat transition, from observer to participant, is when you start facing real tradeoffs. It’s when you stop quoting whitepapers and start debugging production systems. And it’s when your ideals begin to meet reality.\n\nBelow are examples I often bring up when discussing how **pragmatism (not purity) led to success.** These are companies I’ve been learning from.\n\n# Pragmatic Successes\n\n[**PolyMarket**](https://www.polymarket.com/) proved that stablecoins beat custom tokens for early traction in prediction markets. Back in 2016, [Augur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution) kicked off the decentralized prediction markets ecosystem. Most people today haven’t heard of Augur, and know Gnosis mainly as a multisig or credit card company. But, everyone’s heard of PolyMarket, especially after their [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). Their key move was focusing on product over tokenomics, avoiding getting [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by shiny ideals.\n\n[**Solana**](https://www.solana.com/) showed that choosing speed over decentralization can capture real users. Solana’s vision was to run at the speed of the Nasdaq onchain. One of crypto’s deepest ideals is that anyone should be able to run a node or validator at home, in their basement, on a laptop, as part of the network’s collective strength. In practice, running a Solana validator requires professional-grade hardware and DevOps skills. It’s like needing to be an F1 driver just to commute to work. Solana made the hard tradeoff of centralization for performance, and it paid off. With a \\~$91B market cap, pragmatism clearly won.\n\n**Stablecoins** became crypto’s paradoxical success by embracing regulation and existing rails. Bitcoin dreamed of divorcing from the existing financial system; stablecoins married it. Now they’re on track for [$46T in annual volume](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/), with [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) IPOing and the [GENIUS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) adding clarity. They’re as anti-crypto-ideal as it gets, and yet, not showing any signs of slowing down.\n\n[**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/) thrived by offering custody and compliance instead of maximalist purity. Crypto said: *Not your keys, not your coins.* Coinbase said: *Most people don’t want to manage keys.* They made the pragmatic choice to build for real users, not ideals, and onboarded millions because of it.\n\n[**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) is arguably one of the most successful wallets in crypto. Its mission is to bring people onchain, and I’ve heard dozens of founders say it’s the best thing that’s happened to the industry in years. Yet it doesn’t have a token, it isn’t *“crypto-native,”* and it relies heavily on AWS to store user keys \\[1\\]. Its CEO and co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer at FileCoin, a project that embodied true crypto ideals. That experience likely gave him a clear sense of when decentralization helps and when it only slows you down. Privy succeeded by focusing on the user experience over crypto ideals.\n\n**In crypto, pragmatism isn’t about compromise, it’s about sequencing. You can decentralize later. You can tokenize later. But you have to survive in the beginning.**\n\n# It’s Never That Simple\n\nFailure can hinge on one thing. Success demands a harmonic symphony: UI, UX, timing, execution, luck. All must play in tune.\n\nMost people in the OG crypto space start with ideals. That’s good as it draws in smart, mission-driven people. But idealism alone doesn’t build resilient systems.\n\n**Pragmatism doesn’t guarantee success. Idealism often guarantees failure.**\n\nThe only true exceptions? Bitcoin and Ethereum. \\[2\\]\n\n# A Thought to End On\n\n**Decentralization is a byproduct of a permissionless and incentivized system.** It’s an end to a means, not a means to an end.\n\nA fully privacy-preserving, decentralized, permissionless world sounds perfect in theory. In practice, it stalls progress, innovation, and usability.\n\nIn crypto, as in life, **survival belongs to the pragmatists.**\n\n# tl;dr How to Bias Toward Pragmatism over Idealism\n\n1. **Don’t tokenize too early.** Start with stablecoins or fiat rails.\n2. **Don’t decentralize too early.** Use centralized infra, design for later decentralization.\n3. **Find Product-Market Fit first.** Once you have PMF, you can afford ideals and earn the right to strive towards them.\n\n\\---\n\n\\[1\\] Ironically, the world’s most private messenger (Signal) [runs mostly on AWS](https://www.theverge.com/news/807147/signal-aws-outage-meredith-whittaker). It works because users value reliability over purity.\n\n\\[2\\] I’d argue that Zcash is a third exception, but one that’s not known as well (yet).

This update highlights significant financial growth, key integrations, new sponsorships, and upcoming governance proposals that will shape the next phase of the DAO’s development.\n\nThe DAO continues to progress toward formal legal registration through MIDAO, expanding partnerships, and strengthening DeFi use cases for Moons. In the weeks since the last update, we have seen strong revenue inflows, expanded liquidity positions, and new integrations that continue to bring real utility and value to the ecosystem.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of November 9, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $12,168 in non-Moon assets and 823,192 Moons.\n\nMoons decreased by 25,000, representing a transfer to the Community Currency App Bot to refill rewards for outstanding distributions. ETH remains unchanged in quantity but decreased in fiat value due to price movement. The DAO’s stablecoin holdings increased significantly as more sponsorship payments were received.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,192|$52,157|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,998|\n|USDC|6,826|$6,826|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$556|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: $12,168  \nChange since last update: +$3,417  \nStablecoin value (USDC, USDT, USDC.E): $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins since last update: +$3,489\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nArbitrum One: 1,038,094 Moons burned  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,189,800 Moons burned  \nTotal burned: 4,227,894 Moons\n\nSince the October 30 update:  \n• Arbitrum Nova increased by 57,546 Moons (largely from Kraken’s burn event)  \n• Arbitrum One increased by 117 Moons  \n• Combined total increase: 57,663 Moons burned\n\nThese burns highlight continued advertiser demand and the positive impact of large-scale partner events on Moon supply reduction.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nThe DAO now operates two Uniswap liquidity positions to improve balance and fee efficiency.\n\nFirst position (original pool, 0.05% fee tier):  \n• Composition: 67,654 Moons and 960 USDC  \n• Value: $5,455  \n• Total fees earned since last update: $134.37  \n• Breakdown: 1,081 Moons and 62.53 USDC collected  \n• These fees will be redeployed into liquidity after collection\n\nSecond position (new pool, 0.3% fee tier):  \n• Composition: 2,379 Moons and 126.02 USDC  \n• Value: $284.08  \n• Fees earned: $0.74\n\nCombined DAO-owned liquidity value: $5,739.08  \nChange since last update: +$1,948\n\nThese two positions give the DAO flexibility to capture more trading volume during price swings and maintain deeper market presence without needing to sell Moons for rebalancing.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nPolygon Labs has contributed $5,000 in POL tokens to the DAO, equivalent to 25,000 POL for distribution to subreddit users.\n\nFor Moon Week 68, the DAO will distribute 6,820 Moons, reflecting cumulative revenue-based allocation since Epochs 67 and 68.\n\nThe Community Currency App is now fully back online. Redundancies have been added to ensure users can always claim their rewards in the event of future outages.\n\nSince the last update on October 29, the DAO received $8,284 in new revenue from Kraken, Monad, [Rails.xyz](http://Rails.xyz), Quickswap, and ETH Strategy. Kraken’s payment was a pure burn, so the DAO will make up the equivalent amount by allocating future revenues to the Distribution, Treasury, and DAO-Owned Liquidity pools before resuming additional burns.\n\n# 6. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo major proposals will go live this Moon Week:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities that add utility and visibility to Moons.\n\nThese votes mark key next steps for formal structure and operational autonomy within the DAO.\n\n# 7. Teller Integration and Moon Utility\n\nMoons are officially live on Teller, and users can now use their Moons as collateral to borrow USDC or deposit them to earn yield. Teller held an AMA on the subreddit to guide users through the process.\n\nThis integration provides another major use case for Moons in DeFi. Teller’s initial incentive pool is paying a high APY for Moon deposits, funded directly by their treasury, though rewards will decrease over time as total deposits grow.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO’s top priority remains completing legal registration with MIDAO as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize structure, provide legal protection, and enable direct contracting with partners.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n• Continuing DeFi integrations like Teller and Uniswap liquidity expansion  \n• Pursuing grants to support DEX integrations on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n• Building faster bridge solutions between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One  \n• Hosting recurring AMAs and live DAO updates across platforms to expand beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for November 9, 2025. The next update will provide results from the Moon Week 68 governance votes, updated revenue totals, and any additional partnership or liquidity developments.", "lang": null, "likes": 32, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1osv3w1/ccmoon_dao_update_november_9_2025_1_day_prior_to/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

A real transaction, secured by ***Falcon-1024 signatures***, now lives immutably on the Algorand ledger, a transaction that even the world’s most advanced future quantum computer couldn’t break.\n\nFor context, this isn’t just a technical milestone. It’s a statement of intent, one that reshapes what blockchain security means in an era where quantum computing is no longer science fiction but an approaching inevitability.\n\n*“This isn’t theory anymore,”* I added. *“Algorand has crossed the bridge. The rest of the industry is still building.”*\n\n# Why Quantum Resistance Matters\n\nTo understand why this moment matters, you need to understand the risk. Nearly every blockchain today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even most of the newer ones, relies on *RSA* or *elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)* to verify ownership and authenticate transactions. These systems work beautifully against classical computers.\n\nBut against a quantum computer? They crumble.\n\nSince *Peter Shor’s algorithm* in ***1994*** proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum machine could factor large numbers or compute discrete logarithms instantly, cryptographers have known what’s coming. It’s not a matter of *if*, but *when*.\n\nThe danger isn’t just futuristic. There’s what security experts call the *“harvest now, decrypt later”* problem. Bad actors can collect encrypted blockchain data today, store it, and wait until quantum machines mature, then decrypt everything at once.\n\nWhen that day comes, every wallet, signature, and identity built on today’s encryption could be compromised.\n\nThis is why Algorand’s step isn’t about bragging rights. It’s about survival and foresight.\n\n# Falcon: The Cryptographic Shield of the Future\n\nAt the heart of this breakthrough is ***Falcon,*** a lattice-based signature algorithm co-developed by cryptographic heavyweights like *Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert*, and *Vinod Vaikuntanathan,* with contributions from Algorand’s own *Dr. Zhenfei Zhang*.\n\nFalcon, which stands for *Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU*, was selected by *NIST in 2022* as a global standard for post-quantum digital signatures.\n\nIt’s efficient, compact, and incredibly hard to break even for quantum computers.\n\nFalcon comes in two main versions:\n\n* ***Falcon-512***, offering AES-128-level security.\n* ***Falcon-1024***, providing AES-192-level strength — what NIST calls *“Level 5,”* the highest security tier available.\n\nAlgorand uses Falcon-1024. It’s the same signature scheme that already protects Algorand’s *state proofs,*compact cryptographic snapshots that allow other blockchains to verify Algorand’s state without intermediaries.\n\nThe genius here lies in Falcon’s balance:\n\n* Its signatures are larger (around 1,280 bytes) but extremely fast to verify (under 100 microseconds).\n* Signing takes more computation, but verification, the part blockchains do millions of times per day, is lightning-quick.\n\nThat trade-off is perfect for Algorand, where every block involves thousands of signature checks per second.\n\n# Engineering the Impossible\n\nImplementing Falcon in production wasn’t as simple as swapping one signature scheme for another.\n\nFalcon uses *floating-point arithmetic* and *Fast Fourier transforms,* techniques that demand incredible numerical precision. One rounding error, and security could fail.\n\nThe Algorand Foundation’s team tackled this with a deterministic, constant-time implementation, ensuring no randomness or timing leaks that attackers could exploit.\n\nTheir guiding principles were clear:\n\n1. ***No disruption to consensus:*** verification had to remain deterministic.\n2. ***Seamless integration:*** of quantum-secure accounts is needed to act like normal ones.\n3. ***Developer accessibility:*** the system should be easy to use and experiment with.\n\nTo achieve that, Algorand built something elegant: embedding Falcon keys inside *Logic Signatures* smart contracts that control how an account’s funds can be spent.\n\nThese contracts verify Falcon signatures over transaction IDs. If the math checks out, the spend is authorized.\n\nFrom the network’s perspective, it looks no different from a traditional account only it’s *quantum-secure*.\n\n# Building the Tools for a Quantum Future\n\nTo make this accessible, Algorand released the ***Falcon Signatures CLI,*** a command-line toolkit that lets developers actually create, fund, and transact from post-quantum accounts on mainnet or testnet.\n\nDevelopers can:\n\n* Generate Falcon keypairs\n* Derive Algorand addresses from them\n* Fund those addresses\n* Sign and submit Falcon-verified transactions\n\nIn other words, anyone can now mint, sign, and send quantum-resistant transactions.\n\nThat’s not just innovation, it’s democratization of security.\n\n# What’s Protected — and What Isn’t (Yet)\n\nAlgorand’s post-quantum rollout secures individual accounts and the blockchain’s historical state. State proofs — those compact summaries used by other chains — are now fully quantum-resistant.\n\nBut the *consensus layer* still relies on *Ed25519* signatures and **V***erifiable Random Functions (VRFs)* for validator selection. These are classical cryptographic mechanisms that quantum computers could theoretically exploit.\n\nSo while quantum attackers couldn’t steal funds from Falcon-secured accounts, they might still disrupt block proposals or manipulate future consensus events.\n\nThat’s why Algorand’s approach is *incremental but deliberate*: start with user-level protection, gain experience, then move up the stack toward quantum-secure consensus.\n\nIt’s the practical path to secure what’s possible now and evolve systematically.\n\n# Falcon’s Broader Impact\n\nFalcon’s adoption by Algorand has implications far beyond a single blockchain.\n\nBecause it’s *NIST-standardized*, Falcon can act as a *universal language* for cross-chain communication in a *post-quantum world.*\n\nAlgorand’s *state proofs*, already powered by Falcon, could allow other chains to verify data trustlessly with the same cryptographic standard, no intermediaries needed.\n\nThat sets the stage for a *quantum-resistant multichain future* where interoperability and security coexist instead of colliding.\n\nThe open-source Falcon CLI also invites global collaboration developers, cryptographers, even universities can study and improve the system freely.\n\n# The Human Side: Algorand’s 2025 Roadmap\n\nWhile the Falcon achievement represents Algorand’s technical peak, its *2025 roadmap* reveals something just as profound: a shift toward simplicity, usability, and community control.\n\nIn an industry drowning in jargon and fractured ecosystems, Algorand’s message is refreshingly human. The roadmap centers around three core goals:\n\n1. ***Return power to the community***\n2. ***Make blockchain development frictionless***\n3. ***Deliver a user experience that feels like Web2 — but runs on Web3 principles***\n\n# Community Takes the Wheel\n\nAlgorand is handing the steering wheel to its users.\n\nThrough *Project King Safety*, the network plans to redesign its fee and incentive model to ensure long-term sustainability, ending the era of foundation-subsidized economics. A position paper is due in *Q4 2025*, outlining how fees, validator rewards, and network incentives will evolve.\n\nEven more transformative is the *revival of its grant program* under a *new governance structure.*\n\nA community-elected *xGov Council* will now decide which projects get funding — removing centralized gatekeeping and restoring grassroots governance.\n\nThe foundation has already *reduced its stake from 63% to 21%* through a new rewards model, and a *peer-to-peer gossip network* is replacing its centralized relay architecture.\n\nEach of these steps pushes Algorand closer to becoming a *fully peer-to-peer, self-governed ecosystem,*something most blockchains only claim to be.\n\n# Simplifying the Developer Experience\n\nThe next frontier is making blockchain development as easy as writing a mobile app.\n\nIn *early 2026*, Algorand will launch *AlgoKit 4.0,* a major upgrade that introduces composable smart contract libraries, key-value storage *(“Schema”)*, and native support for mainstream languages like ***Rust****,* ***Swift***, and ***Kotlin***.\n\nDevelopers will even be able to use ***AI assistants***, powered by large language models, to help write and debug contracts, merging artificial intelligence and blockchain into a single development flow.\n\n*“Algorand is building a bridge for developers who don’t want to learn ten new programming languages just to build on Web3.”*\n\nFor enterprises, *Intermezzo*, debuting in *Q3 2025*, will handle all the hard stuff: key management, blockchain integration, and compliance. Businesses will be able to launch blockchain-backed loyalty programs, digital assets, or identity systems with almost no technical friction.\n\nAnd for users? That’s where *Rocca Wallet* comes in.\n\n# Rocca Wallet: Web3 Without the Headache\n\nIf Falcon is the brain of Algorand’s evolution, *Rocca Walle***t** is its face.\n\nSet for *preview in Q4 2025* and an *open-source release in 2026*, Rocca aims to eliminate one of the biggest pain points in the crypto complex: intimidating wallets.\n\nIt supports *passkey logins* (no seed phrases), *fee abstraction* (users don’t even see *“gas*”), and *decentralized identity* (no centralized logins or data leaks).\n\nIt’s also *white-label*, meaning DApps can brand and customize it so the blockchain experience can fade into the background, letting usability take center stage.\n\nIn short, Rocca makes Web3 feel like Web2 only safer, faster, and fully decentralized.\n\n# Powering the Real World\n\nAlgorand’s 2025 vision also extends beyond the screen. It’s targeting real industries where blockchain can quietly improve everyday life:\n\n1. ***Tokenized Financial Products*****:** Using the *ACTUS framework*, Algorand is building smart contract models for tokenized debt and equity, with a *Debt ASA MVP* expected by *Q4 2025*.\n2. ***Agentic Commerce*****:** Supporting AI agents that can transact autonomously via ***X402*** and *A2A payments,* blurring the line between AI and DeFi.\n3. ***Self-Sovereign Identity*****:** The Rocca Wallet will enable verifiable credentials — like *WorldChess’s Universal Chess Passport*, which lets players compete globally without centralized logins.\n4. ***Data Integrity*****:** Strengthening blockchain’s role as a permanent, verifiable record for supply chains, enterprises, and beyond.\n\n# Privacy, Scalability, and the Quantum Edge\n\nAlgorand isn’t just catching up — it’s leaping ahead.\n\nIts upgraded ***AlgoPlonk*** zero-knowledge system will make privacy faster and more flexible, while exploration into *multiparty computation (MPC)* and *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* lays the groundwork for transactions that remain private even while being processed.\n\nMeanwhile, *parallel execution* and *block pipelining* are set to supercharge scalability, allowing multiple transactions to run at once and cutting block confirmation times even further.\n\nAnd in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the *first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*\n\n# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats\n\nIf the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.\n\nBut what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a *guardian layer,* a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?\n\nThat’s precisely where ***Algorand*** could step in.\n\nThrough its ***Falcon-based state proofs*** and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a ***quantum-safe validation hub*****,** a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing *BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins* to operate within a *quantum-secure environment* without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.\n\nImagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand’s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand’s *quantum-proof framework,* preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.\n\n*“If Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,”* I noted, *“it could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.”*\n\nThis kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to *stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails* as well. Since Algorand’s state proofs already support *trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.\n\nIt’s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand’s technology isn’t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be *future-proofing everyone else*, too.\n\n# Staying True to Web3’s Promise\n\nWhile other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:\n\n* *Transparency*\n* *Security*\n* *Community-led governance*\n* *Sustainability*\n\nIts uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn’t even exist yet.\n\n# A Glimpse at the Horizon\n\nAlgorand’s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.\n\nFalcon’s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  \nThe 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren’t opposites; they’re the same path forward.\n\nTogether, they redefine what *“Web3 readiness”* really means.\n\nIt’s not about speculation.

The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.\n\nBefore Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.\n\nBeyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.\n\nBeyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nEvery operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.\n\nAcross Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.\n\nThe effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.\n\nIn parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.\n\nTogether, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.\n\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.

Ask us anything about the BONK Launchpad and the BONK DAT, BNKK Hello r/CryptoCurrency,\n\nWe are contributors from the BONK ( r/BONKfunOfficial ) ecosystem and team members involved with BONKfun and the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (Bonk Inc., ticker BNKK). We are here to discuss BONK’s ecosystem growth, the launchpad model, and how the treasury operates.\n\n# About BONK\n\nBONK is a community-driven token on Solana focused on building products that generate real activity and direct value toward the token. The BONK ecosystem includes BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, an NFT marketplace, and consumer-facing applications that bring new users to Solana. BONK currently has more than 400 integrations, operates on 13 chains, and is approaching one million onchain holders.\n\n# About BONKfun\n\nBONK . fun is a launchpad for meme tokens built around transparent economics. It allows anyone to create a token in minutes, with fees distributed to support the BONK ecosystem. Half of all platform fees are used to buy and burn BONK, 8 percent are used for BONK accumulation, and the remainder fund operations and development. Public dashboards track activity, fees, and burns in real time. The platform has become the largest launchpad on Solana, accounting for more than half of all new token launches in mid-2025.\n\n# About the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (BNKK)\n\nBonk Inc. (Nasdaq: BNKK) is the public-markets digital asset treasury dedicated to BONK accumulation. It receives a 10 percent revenue share from BONKfun and reinvests about 90 percent of that income into open-market BONK purchases. The company currently holds about 2.75 percent of BONK’s circulating supply and has stated a target of 5 percent by the end of 2025. The treasury is actively managed through partnerships with institutional asset managers to generate non-dilutive yield and preserve capital.\n\nThis structure connects ecosystem activity with public-company participation. Revenue from BONKfun creates recurring buy pressure, while the treasury establishes a corporate vehicle aligned with BONK’s long-term growth.\n\n# Topics we can discuss during the AMA\n\n* How BONKfun works and what differentiates it from other launchpads\n* The structure of BONK’s burn and buyback system\n* The design and purpose of the BONK Digital Asset Treasury\n* How revenue from BONKfun and other applications flows into BONK accumulation\n* The broader BONK ecosystem and integrations on Solana and other chains\n* The significance of approaching one million holders and the planned one-percent supply burn\n* The role of Bonk Inc. in bridging onchain activity with traditional finance\n\nWe will be answering questions from this thread during the AMA window.\n\nThank you for having us, and we look forward to your questions.\n\n— The BONK Team", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 79, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oq0oqq/ama_we_are_the_bonk_team_ask_us_anything_about/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Public companies and onchain organizations are increasingly holding tokens as long-term assets. To date, most treasuries have focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin. These assets offer stability and liquidity, but their size limits how much impact new accumulation can have.\n\nBONK occupies a different position. With a market capitalization of about $1 billion dollars, it sits in the mid-cap range, supported by an expanding ecosystem and a growing treasury. We believe this combination of scale and structure gives BONK a higher potential for compounding growth than the larger, slower-moving assets dominating current treasuries.\n\nThe BONK Digital Asset Treasury is operated through Bonk Inc. (BNKK). The company currently holds about 2.75% of the circulating supply and aims to reach 5% by the end of 2025. It earns a 10% revenue share from BONKfun and allocates roughly 90 percent of that income to open-market BONK purchases. This model transforms ecosystem activity into continuous, recurring accumulation.\n\nEach percentage of supply added to the treasury represents tens of millions of dollars in new demand. Because BONK’s market cap is smaller than traditional treasury assets, this level of accumulation has a more visible effect on overall market depth and pricing.\n\nBONK’s ecosystem is one of the most comprehensive among meme coins. It spans more than 400 integrations and operates on 13 chains. Core components include BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, and an NFT marketplace, along with partnerships in sports, fitness, and entertainment. These products anchor BONK’s position within Solana while expanding its utility beyond trading.\n\nThe community is also approaching one million onchain holders. When that threshold is reached, a 1% supply burn will take place. Combined with ongoing burns from ecosystem products, this structure reinforces BONK’s deflationary design and long-term alignment with active users.\n\nWhat separates BONK from other digital asset treasuries is its leverage to growth. Large-cap assets require massive inflows to move the market, while BONK’s scale allows smaller amounts of new demand to create measurable change. It maintains liquidity across Solana and additional chains, offering accessibility while retaining room for appreciation.\n\nMost existing treasuries simply hold their assets. BONK’s approach creates a feedback loop in which product success funds further accumulation. It connects platform revenue, community activity, and corporate structure under one framework that compounds over time.\n\nBONK combines the community energy of a meme token with the operational discipline of a public treasury. It is verifiable, active, and built on a foundation of measurable economic inputs rather than speculation.\n\nIn the broader context of digital asset treasuries, BONK illustrates how smaller-cap assets can use real revenue and structured accumulation to drive value. It represents a faster, more reflexive model with the potential for greater upside as the ecosystem and treasury continue to expand.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1opcve8/bonks_digital_asset_treasury/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The past few weeks have been full of major progress across governance, treasury, partnerships, and real-world DAO formation efforts. What began as a decentralized subreddit project is now moving closer than ever to becoming a legally recognized organization with active DeFi integrations and expanding sources of revenue.\n\nThe most exciting development is that the DAO is now on the verge of becoming an officially recognized legal entity through MIDAO, based in the Marshall Islands. After a meeting with MIDAO representatives, we were offered a discounted rate of $6,100 through 2026 (normally $12,500) to register as a non-profit DAO LLC. This will give CCMOON DAO legal standing, limited liability protections, and greater legitimacy in future partnerships. A proposal is live now on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta, and the vote is scheduled for Moon Week 68.\n\nAnother major milestone is the Teller integration on Arbitrum One. Moons are now live on Teller, a decentralized lending protocol, offering 22% APY paid directly in Moons. Teller is funding this program from its own treasury by making market purchases of Moons to pay rewards. Within the first 48 hours, more than 1.5 million Moons—over $100,000 worth—were deposited. This is a massive leap forward for Moon utility and onchain participation.\n\nWe have also filled another key DAO Officer role, adding a Technology &amp; Infrastructure Officer. The current officer roster and open positions are listed below. The Community Engagement Officer and Ecosystem Growth Officer positions remain open, and the usual 50,000 Moon holding requirement has been removed so more members can participate. If you’d like to nominate yourself, you can do so on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta.\n\nOver the last 2.5 weeks, the DAO received about $5,000 in new revenue from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, BONKfun, and Polygon. This continues our growing stream of recurring payments that support burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity.\n\nLet’s take a look at where everything stands as of October 30.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\n* CCMOON DAO Constitution v 0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution) \n* Website: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/) \n* rCryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0) \n* Governance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth) \n* Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck) \n* Transparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of October 30, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $71,370 in total value.  \nThe last update on October 13 reported a treasury value of $76,865. While total value has decreased by roughly $5,495, the non-Moon portion of the treasury has increased by about $610, and the stablecoin portion (USDC, USDT, USDC.E) has increased by approximately $1,224. This reflects real growth in liquid assets despite the price decline in Moons.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|848,192|$62,618|\n|ETH|0.83683|$3,105|\n|USDC|3,337|$3,337|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$521|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: approximately $8,750  \nChange since last update: +$610 non-Moon value (+$1,224 in stablecoins)\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nTotal and change since October 13 update -\n\nArbitrum One: 1,037,977 Moons burned (+16,616)  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,132,254 Moons burned (+10)  \nTotal burned: 4,170,231 Moons (+16,626)\n\nThese burns continue to demonstrate healthy advertising and partner activity across the DAO’s integrated platforms.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nDAO-Owned Liquidity is held in the USDC–MOON pool on Uniswap.\n\nUniswap Pool: [https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650](https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650)  \nWallet for tracking: 0x33D549e99bae2Ff38cA1AdB280f77151C86E1b3c\n\nCurrent position value: $3,791  \nComposition: 29,210 Moons and 1,615 USDC\n\nFees earned since the last update: $21.13  \nMoon size since Oct 13: +6880 MOON   \nUSDC size since Oct 13: +733 USDC  \nTotal DOL growth since last report: +$964 in total value\n\nThe DAO moved from a v4 to v3 Uniswap pool to ensure integration compatibility with Teller. This pool is now the reference pricing source for many DeFi applications on Arbitrum and will continue to earn fees and reinvest them.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nDistributions continue to follow the new 12-month revenue-based model approved in the previous update. Assuming no additional burns, approximately 4,000 Moons will be distributed each period.\n\nThe app used to claim Moons and poll rewards is currently offline due to AWS and Microsoft outages. The technical team is working with service providers to restore functionality and evaluating redundancies to prevent similar downtime in the future.\n\nWe are also exploring additional sponsorship-based distributions similar to the previous Polygon campaign that contributed $5,000 in POL tokens for subreddit users.\n\n# 6. Sponsorships and Partnerships\n\nRevenue received since October 13 totals approximately $5,000, with payments from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), and Polygon. These funds were allocated across burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity per the standard 25/25/25/25 split.\n\nUpcoming and active AMAs include Teller (live now), SurfAI, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), Pineapple, Trezor, and multiple Monad announcement posts and AMAs.\n\nTransparency and payment tracking are visible at:  \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\n# 7. Moons on Arbitrum One\n\nMax total supply: 9,668,157 MOON\n\nHolder distribution:  \nCamelot v3 pool – 1.8M (18.75%)  \nTeller supply – \\~1.5M (15.23%)  \nBurn address – 1.04M (10.74%)  \nDAO multisig treasury – 848K (8.77%)\n\nOver one-third of the total supply is now actively productive in DeFi pools, burned, or held in the treasury.  \nExcluding the burned supply, that rises to around 40%.  \nIf the DAO multisig is also excluded, nearly 45% of all circulating Moons on Arbitrum on are now engaged in active DeFi use cases.\n\n# 8. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo proposals are currently live on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities to support Moon utility and development. \n\nBoth proposals are scheduled for a Moon Week 68 vote.\n\n# 9. Bridge Development\n\nThe DAO is exploring new bridging solutions to improve movement of Moons between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One. Current bridging options are limited and slow—most notably, the canonical Arbitrum bridge requires a six-and-a-half-day transfer period. We are reaching out to third-party bridge teams to create a faster and more user-friendly path between networks.\n\nUsers are encouraged to move Moons to Arbitrum One if they wish to participate in integrations like Teller and future DeFi partnerships, as Arbitrum One currently has broader ecosystem support.\n\n# 10. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO’s number one goal remains to complete legal registration as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize our status, protect contributors, and allow direct contracting with partners and advertisers.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n• Expanding DeFi utility for Moons via Teller and Uniswap integrations  \n• Pursuing grants to fund a DEX integration on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n• Building a faster cross-chain bridge for Nova to One liquidity  \n• Hosting recurring AMAs and live update streams to reach broader audiences beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for October 30, 2025.

Our goal is to allow users to supply single tokens and earn more of the *same* token with no dual-asset pairs, no impermanent loss, and no lockups.\n\nFor example, you supply $MOON, you earn more $MOON automatically -- Simple. No gimmicks.\n\n**How does Teller work?**\n\n* We initially launched our [rewards program on Base](https://blog.teller.org/earn-compounding-yield-on-base-tokens-with-teller/) and have now expanded it to other networks: you can supply and stake your favorite tokens on Teller to earn up to **22% APY** per block.\n* No lock-ups. You can withdraw anytime.\n* No impermanent loss, because the protocol doesn’t use AMM style liquidity pools for lending. Instead: peer-to-pool lending. Borrowers draw from a pool; lenders deposit; borrowers repay interest.\n* As borrowing demand rises, the APY can go higher (ranging from 20-60%) because yield comes from borrower interest payments + our incentive program.\n* Once liquidity in a pool hits $100K, expect the incentive portion to gradually decline, with the organic borrowing interest taking over more of the yield burden.\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\n* For token holders: you can hold a token you believe in, deposit it, and earn more of that same token, rather than converting into something else and dealing with pairs or LP tokens.\n* For risk control: because you're supplying single assets and there's no AMM, you avoid impermanent loss (which happens when you provide LP tokens and the relative price of the assets changes).\n* Transparent incentives: We’ve laid out how the yield is constructed (incentive side + borrower interest side) so users can understand what they’re participating in.\n\n**What are the risks?**\n\n* Lending always has default risk — borrowers might not repay. The protocol isolates pools by token to reduce cross-token risk. If a borrower does default then the collateral is put up on an onchain dutch auction, sold, and then returned to the pool.\n* Liquidity risk: While the protocol allows withdrawal anytime, if a large part of the liquidity is borrowed, there could be constraints (or interest rates might go up).\n* Token risk: Because you’re holding a token, you’re exposed to price volatility of that asset (even though there's no impermanent loss).\n* There is always contract risk, as with any protocol. However, Teller is 3 years old, has been audited 3 times, and uses Hypernative to protect against reentrancy attacks.\n\n**Holding $MOON?**\n\nThere is currently over 1% of the $MOON supply staked on Teller!\n\nYou can now supply and stake your MOONs to start earning more MOONs.\n\nSee the image below for an example of how much you can earn:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/np0gxios1byf1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7e011c5d2c53fa1cfe75092234286e251eeec0\n\n\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/ama-teller-launches-rewards-program-earn-22-compounding-v0-j7ktwmji0byf1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7003ebfd53a6d4a4ecbc485c1c2d0543c5525db6)\n\n**How you can start earning:**\n\nStep 1: Go to [app.teller.org](https://t.co/Qi6U79QY9X)\n\nStep 2: Connect your wallet \n\nStep 3: Select your network\n\nStep 4: Select a lending pool \n\nStep 5: Supply + Stake your tokens and start earning 22% yield\n\n\n\n**Ask us anything!**", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 71, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oka1vr/ama_teller_launches_rewards_program_earn_22/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

That includes ETH, stETH, LP tokens, Aave positions, or WBTC — not just stablecoins like USDC. The assets stay on Ethereum Layer 1, continuing to earn yield, while traders open and manage positions on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nThe key innovation here is that this cross-layer collateralization is **fully verifiable through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs**, not bridges, oracles, or multisig custodians. Earlier systems couldn’t do this because ZK tech wasn’t mature enough to efficiently prove complex financial state changes (like order matching, margin calls, and liquidations) at scale. Lighter built custom ZK circuits and a specialized “Order Book Tree” that make it computationally feasible to verify every operation — including those involving collateral that never leaves Ethereum.\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Collateral stays on Ethereum (L1)** You lock ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or other supported assets into Lighter’s L1 smart contracts. They remain on Ethereum, keeping their native yield (e.g. stETH still earns staking rewards).\n2. **Collateral is registered in the L2 state** Lighter’s rollup records the locked asset in its state tree so it can be used for trading margin. The L2 handles execution through a low-latency sequencer and proves every transaction with ZK circuits.\n3. **Trading happens on L2** Orders are matched on a central-limit order book. You can trade any listed pair using the collateral value of your L1 assets. None of your assets move unless you’re liquidated.\n4. **Liquidations and settlements are cryptographically enforced** If a position becomes under-collateralized, the L2 generates a ZK proof of the liquidation event. That proof is submitted to Lighter’s Ethereum contract, which verifies it and automatically releases only the required portion of the locked collateral. No human intervention, no trust assumptions.\n5. **Full composability with DeFi** Because assets remain on Ethereum, they can still interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem — earning yield or being tokenized for use elsewhere. The same logic applies in reverse: DeFi positions can serve as margin on Lighter.\n\n# Why It’s Different\n\nPrevious perpetual DEXs and L1 derivatives platforms faced trade-offs:\n\n* **Bridges and oracles** introduced trust and delay (often hacked or manipulated).\n* **Monolithic alt-L1s** like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid had to rebuild their own ecosystems, isolating liquidity.\n* **Optimistic rollups** could not liquidate in real time due to challenge periods.\n* **ZK rollups** before now couldn’t efficiently prove multi-asset financial logic.\n\nLighter’s architecture removes these limits. Cross-margining multiple DeFi assets becomes **provably safe** — verifiable on Ethereum with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n# Why It Matters\n\n* **Capital efficiency:** traders can use yield-earning assets without selling or wrapping them.\n* **Security:** all collateral and state roots are settled on Ethereum; nothing depends on a bridge.\n* **Verifiability:** every trade, liquidation, and collateral adjustment is backed by a ZK proof.\n* **Integration:** native composability with Ethereum means Lighter can plug into existing DeFi protocols instead of competing with them.\n\nIf it works as described, UCM could shift on-chain trading from isolated collateral systems to a **capital-agnostic model**, where any Ethereum asset can serve as trustless margin — something earlier generations of DeFi simply couldn’t do.\n\n# Sources\n\nLighter whitepaper (October 2025) — discusses the core architecture, Order Book Tree, ZK-proof system and collateral logic. - [https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf](https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nInterview on the Bankless podcast with founder Vladimir Novakovski — confirms the roadmap including Universal Cross Margin and the ZKVM sidecar. - [https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex](https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ojuslv/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

For the first time in several years, the story, the data, and the execution all align. POL’s market capitalization grew 39.2% quarter over quarter to $2.36 billion dollars, outperforming the broader crypto market, which rose by 20%. Network activity, institutional participation, and technical upgrades all moved forward in sync.\n\nWhat excites me most about this report is that it validates what many of us who follow Polygon closely have been sensing. After a few years of searching for direction, Polygon has rediscovered its identity and is executing with focus. The growth across payments, real-world assets, and interoperability shows a network building for real adoption rather than temporary hype.\n\nHistory Lesson - Polygon was one of the most prominent blockchains during 2021 and 2022. Back then, MATIC was a household name in crypto. DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and gaming applications all flocked to Polygon. It was fast, cheap, and part of Ethereum’s scaling future.\n\nThen the market cooled, prices dropped, and Polygon’s identity blurred. It continued shipping technology, but the narrative was less defined. The ecosystem became large, but scattered, and the token’s performance reflected that uncertainty.\n\nIn 2025, that changed. Polygon refocused around two themes with real-world traction: payments and real-world assets. This focus unified its ecosystem under one clear goal of building the financial and transactional backbone for onchain economies. The Messari data shows that this strategy is working. Stablecoin growth, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure upgrades are moving together.\n\nThe chain has a strong foundation and a clear direction. The 39% market-cap surge in Q3 is the first tangible signal that the market recognizes that turnaround. To me, it feels like the beginning of Polygon’s second act.\n\nThe market performance in Q3 represents renewed confidence in execution. POL now ranks as the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 token by market capitalization, behind Mantle and ahead of Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. More than 99% of the supply has transitioned from MATIC to POL, completing one of the largest token migrations in the industry.\n\nPolygon’s outperformance is supported by onchain metrics. Daily active addresses increased by 13%, daily transactions rose 20%, and the average transaction fee declined by 23% in POL terms. These metrics indicate expanding usage and improving efficiency at the same time.\n\nWhen I look at these numbers, I see a market beginning to price real fundamentals again. The price action is following execution, which is what sustainable growth looks like.\n\nPolygon’s payments ecosystem is one of the strongest indicators of real adoption. In Q3, stablecoin supply increased 22% to $2.94 billion. USDT alone grew 35% to $1.4B, while USDC maintained close to $1B.\n\nMore importantly, those stablecoins are being used. Payments-focused applications on Polygon facilitated $1.82B in transaction volume across more than 50 platforms during the quarter, up 49% from Q2.\n\nPolygon has also become a hub for innovative payments infrastructure. What excites me most about this growth is that it represents genuine economic activity. They are transfers, purchases, and settlements happening on a scalable blockchain that costs a fraction of a cent per transaction. This is what a functional onchain payments network looks like.\n\nIf payments show real consumer traction, real-world assets show that institutions are taking Polygon seriously. The total value of tokenized RWAs on Polygon reached $1.14B (recently grew to $1.6B last week) by the end of Q3. The issuers include government agencies, state banks, and regulated financial entities.\n\nGermany’s NRW Bank issued a 100 million euro bond on Polygon under electronic securities law. Spain’s BeToken launched one of Europe’s first fully regulated equity token offerings. The Philippines Department of Budget and Management implemented a blockchain-based system to track public funds, improving transparency in government spending. Justoken launched tokens backed by physical commodities such as soybeans and soybean oil, with a combined value of over $450M.\n\nThese projects mark a shift from experimentation to production. Institutions are using Polygon for financial instruments that carry legal and regulatory weight. This is the kind of adoption that builds long-term credibility. When state banks and government agencies issue assets on a public chain, it changes the perception of blockchain entirely.\n\nFor me, this is one of the most exciting parts of the Polygon story in 2025. Real capital is entering the ecosystem, and it is doing so on Polygon because of its reliability, low cost, and Ethereum alignment.\n\nWhile institutional adoption is accelerating, developer momentum has been equally strong. Polygon ranks fourth in global blockchain developer interest in 2025, behind Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. This shows that the ecosystem continues to attract new builders even as competition increases.\n\nThe Agglayer Incubator Program has become a central piece of this growth. The Agglayer connects multiple chains into a unified liquidity network, creating an environment where assets and users move seamlessly between ecosystems. \n\nSeveral breakout projects have emerged from this initiative. Katana, a DeFi-optimized Layer 2 chain, launched earlier this year with deep liquidity and sustainable yield mechanisms. Miden continues to advance zero-knowledge virtual machine research. Billions focuses on institutional DeFi infrastructure, while other projects explore areas such as onchain identity and privacy.\n\nThis expanding network of independent but interoperable chains is what sets Polygon apart in 2025. It is not competing to be a single chain; it is building an interconnected ecosystem under the Agglayer framework.\n\nPolygon’s resurgence is also visible in its community engagement. **On October 1, 2025, Polygon became the first blockchain to formally sponsor and participate in** r/CryptoCurrency **as a Community Sponsor.** They are officially a sponsor of this subreddit and have distributed $5000 in POL rewards to users of the sub.\n\nAccording to Surf AI’s (another AMA participant) sentiment analysis, Polygon leads all Layer 2 solutions in positive Reddit discussions, with 78 percent bullish mentions compared to 62 percent for competitors. This shows that sentiment around Polygon has turned positive again as users see progress across the ecosystem.\n\nThe renewed focus on education and open communication reflects Polygon’s effort to focusing meaningfully in crypto communities and cultures. I view this community alignment as a strong sign of maturity.\n\nSeveral major developments this quarter have strengthened Polygon’s position further.\n\n* **Institutional Staking:** AMINA Bank launched regulated POL staking on October 9, 2025, offering compliant yield opportunities for institutional investors. This could unlock large amounts of capital from entities that have been waiting for regulatory clarity.\n* **Polymarket Expansion:** Polymarket, one of the most active applications on Polygon, saw its trading volume increase tenfold year over year in 2025. It now represents a significant share of Polygon’s DeFi activity and recently completed a $2B raise at a $9B valuation.\n* **Developer and Institutional Leadership:** Polygon continues to attract developers and enterprises alike through programs such as the Agglayer Incubator.\n* **Vitalik Buterin’s Endorsement:** In mid-October 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly praised Polygon’s contributions to Ethereum scalability and its early leadership in zero-knowledge research.\n\nOne of the most exciting developments this week is Polygon Labs’ collaboration with Manifold Trading, a quantitative investment firm specializing in institutional-grade liquidity. This partnership represents a major leap toward professional market standards in decentralized finance.\n\nManifold will bring data-driven liquidity management, quantitative market-making, and tighter spreads to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. In traditional markets, firms like Manifold ensure smooth execution and consistent pricing across venues. That structure has largely been missing in DeFi, where liquidity often sits idle or fragmented across decentralized exchanges.\n\nBy applying institutional execution practices to onchain markets, Polygon and Manifold are building a system that offers predictable depth and lower slippage. For context, compressing the spread on a one-million-dollar trade from 50 basis points to 5 basis points can save more than 4,000 dollars in execution costs. Scaled across billions in trading volume, these efficiencies make DeFi truly investable at institutional scale.\n\nManifold’s strategies will operate across Polygon’s major decentralized exchanges to harmonize pricing and ensure new markets launch with meaningful depth from day one.\n\nFor fintechs and neobanks exploring onchain payments or tokenized asset trading, the benefits are immediate. Polygon’s network can now deliver the execution quality and stability of traditional financial systems while maintaining the transparency and openness of DeFi.\n\nThis is a direct extension of the vision Polygon has been building toward all year. With infrastructure capable of 5,000-plus transactions per second, sub-five-second finality, and unified cross-chain liquidity through the Agglayer, the network is becoming a full-stack solution for global payments and institutional finance. The Manifold partnership makes that vision tangible by turning liquidity itself into an institutional-grade product.\n\nPolygon’s infrastructure progress has been equally important. The Bhilai Hardfork, Heimdall v2, and Rio Testnet upgrades have all delivered major performance improvements.\n\nThe Bhilai Hardfork increased throughput to over 1,000 transactions per second, raised the block gas limit, and implemented account abstraction through EIP-7702. Heimdall v2 reduced transaction finality from one to two minutes down to approximately five seconds by upgrading the consensus layer. The Rio Testnet, which is moving toward mainnet, introduces stateless verification and validator redesigns that could enable up to 5,000 transactions per second.\n\nPolygon also launched Agglayer CDK Enterprise, a toolkit that allows institutions to deploy privacy-enabled EVM chains that remain interoperable with the main ecosystem. This combination of scalability, privacy, and interoperability is a major step toward institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAverage transaction fees have dropped to roughly 0.0027 dollars, making Polygon one of the most efficient networks in the space. For payments and RWAs, those economics are critical.\n\nPolygon’s 2025 story is one of renewal. The network has moved from a period of uncertainty to a position of clear strength. Its focus on payments, real-world assets, and interoperability has created measurable growth across both retail and institutional segments.\n\nThe community is re-engaged, the developer base is expanding, and institutions are beginning to trust Polygon for real financial applications. The Messari report captures this turning point with data, but the larger narrative is about execution and focus.\n\nThe 39% rise in market capitalization in Q3 is, in my view, only an early indication of what lies ahead. Polygon has rebuilt its foundation, aligned its strategy with real demand, and positioned itself at the center of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Polygon could become one of the most important networks in the next phase of blockchain adoption.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oil6xd/polygon_has_supported_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_im/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline.\n\nThat’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie.\n\nContext matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters.\n\nThe bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades.\n\nOne interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end.\n\nMy read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon.

IonQ timeline is way ahed of NIST's deadline.\n\nI also liked that he spelt it out: those acting dismissively have invariably never had any real understanding of quantum computing.\n\nIn the meantime, keep buying Bitcoin.\n\nEDIT: A good review of the current (Sep 2025) post-quantum migration landscape for a few major blockchains, including ECDSA based ones (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) and EdDSA ones (Solana, Sui, Aptos, etc), is: *\"Post-Quantum Blockchain: Transition Landscape Amidst Evolving Complexity\"* https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1626 (thanks u/Tsmacks1 for the pointer). Some of the references in there are also good reads.\n\nCrypto bros have traditionally dismissed it all and also claimed \"The world will have much bigger problems if RSA or ECC is cracked.\" which is funny when you think about it, because out of all the big &amp; high stake systems you could attack,  a crypto network would likely be one of the first, simply because attacking other big &amp; high stake systems has a higher risk of sending you to jail. In other words, the other big systems have an inherent higher level of protection.\n\nThe problem of \"lost\" coins is a big one, as those aren't protected. People no longer in control of private keys (lost, dead, etc) will not be able to upgrade, so their coins will be available to crackers. Devs can theoretically block those addresses but that's a big pandora's box and I don't see it happening in Bitcoin as it would undermine the whole thesis of \"nobody controls Bitcoin\" (plus devs don't actually know if an address is dead). They possibly could add functionality to the chain such that a quantum private key derived from a classic key can unlock the funds, giving the true owner a bit of time to claim their coins before crackers get to it.\n\nLost coins have no legislation protecting them. If you crack it, it's yours. Cracking equipment at first will only be available to QC manufacturers themselves, then big corps, then governments, before organized crime and smaller crime can afford/get their hands on it.

It’s now my full time job.\n\nBut I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders.\n\nI also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward.

A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.\n\nFed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators.\n\n* AI + Payments: The Fed’s hyped on AI for fraud, risk, and routing, perfect for programmable L1s and L2s like Ethereum.\n* Ethereum’s Throne: With \\~60% of DeFi’s TVL, ETH’s liquidity, tooling, and institutional heft make it the king of this shift.\n\nAltcoin Season Is Coming!\n\nThe Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.\n\nWhy Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment.\n\nWhat’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti. But the Fed’s moving fast, and DeFi’s in the driver’s seat. Watch Ethereum, compliant stablecoins, and altcoins building for the long game. Altcoin season is coming, the fuse is lit.\n\nAlways be mindful that news can be overhyped. Invest wisely by DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk . Keep an eye on ETH as a market leader, it hasn’t made a durable break above its ATH yet.

I have to admit, I'm kind of a fan of PAXG.  PAXG if you don't know is an ERC-20 coin soft-pegged to gold.  I've held it for quite a while as my long term flight to safety when not actively trading.  That kind of worked out in my favor recently.  I'm glad I wasn't trading.\n\nI'll tell you what I don't like about it.  Pretty expensive to move around.  We are talking like $3.  Now in the grand scheme of things that's tiny.  But what I mean by this is I wish it wasn't just a decent value store.  I wish it was transactable.\n\nNow this is where I'm going to date how up to date my knowledge is.  Not very.  I nerded out on crypto quite a while ago and then didn't keep up.  Hence the question.\n\nIn theory there are wrappers that could make it transactable.  Probably more wrappers than an old hat like me could keep track of.  The question is what would actually be good?  I know polygon, solana, and avalanche are used to wrap things.  No matter what is picked there can be more that one route to actual funding.  One could do a bridge that would incur the high paxg fees at least.  One could exchange it on a dex.  But then you have to find a dex that has decent activity for what is fairly obscure.  I would argue it shouldn't be.  I wish wrapped PAXG was a common coin.\n\nThat's why it's worth asking the new hats.  I probably sound like I know more than I do.  I'm a technical dude but with the last few years of crypto I've mostly just kept up with vocab.  That's a pretty shallow level of understanding.  I'm confident in my technical abilities enough to admit when my understanding is shallow in an area.\n\nI do think gold is going to keep going up long term.  And the demand for exchange in gold is going to go up even faster than that.  The perceived future demand for gold based transaction is leading the price.  I also think that crypto is about to hit another period of significant volatility, more so than recent.  In what direction I don't know, but I fear it might be down.  More institutions that need to exchange real value are having to do it more often as they are being confronted with the real-politik of the current era.\n\nWe are now in an era of massive transition.  We think AI is causing a lot of transition in our lives but these transitions aren't isolated to us.  Some of the most core institutions are finding themselves in fast moving times compared to what they are used to.  Their standard rate of change is usually akin to molasses or pitch.  We have fiat currencies coming out of existence, like the Argentine peso, and CBDC being attempted, BRICS trying to be a thing, state sponsored resource competition to get the hardware setup for AI, and proxy conflicts between major powers.  And these institutions need to exchange real value when they make changes at the lowest level.  Just like we can exchange on-chain and off-chain, institutions have on-chain and off-chain.  And they have more demand to do more on-chain activity than they have in the past or think that they may need to do on-chain activity in the near future.  And on-chain for them is gold.\n\nMeanwhile on the consumer end, with attempts to create CBDC, many are going to want to prefer solutions they own to do the same thing.  People are going to want to do fast and convenient crypto.  And they are going to want to do it with more stability with something people recognize as having value and governments and institutions recognize as having value being a bonus.  And as mentioned before governments and institutions will very much be recognizing gold.\n\nAn era of gold may be upon us, if we want it.  If we can only get the transactability working smooth.  So let's figure it out.  Let's figure out what we are doing and what the standard is to move gold from phone to phone as fast as possible with the lowest fees.  The more of us that know what that standard is the more of us can do it and lead that standard.  This can be a good foot wedged in door alternative to CBDC.  And if we move fast and get that food in the door quickly we can keep the world crypto and free instead of CBDC and controlled.  It also may be harder for government to fight it economically if it exchanges something they themselves need to recognize.\n\nSo back to the technical side.

Assumedly these companies would have to sell the treasury asset to repay antsy trad-fi investors creating further downward pressure on their and other crypto treasury companies holdings.\n\n# Alts\n\nObviously this scenario would be extremely concerning for treasury companies focusing on alts which might have limited liquidity (see the recent flash crash against all alts last week).

Could either drop enough that treasury companies would be forced to sell causing cascading losses across the entire crypto industry?\n\n\\------\n\nI don't know the answer, I'm sure some people here are very familiar with the topic and could answer that.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1o8gnmj", "author": "vantage7", "handle": "vantage7", "created_utc": 1760644986.0, "text": "Pyth Network Industries I was talking to AI about what future the Pyth Network could hold after partnering with Kalshi and AI got me thinking after this response.\n\nPyth Network’s ultra-low latency oracle infrastructure, capable of delivering price and event data updates in milliseconds, uniquely positions it to transform multiple industries that rely on real-time external data. Traditionally concentrated in decentralized finance (DeFi), Pyth’s technology now has cross-industry potential across sectors requiring rapid, reliable, and verifiable data delivery. Here’s how Pyth can tap into key industries:\n\n\nFinancial Services and Trading:\n\nPyth’s origins and strengths lie in finance, where millisecond-level price feed speed is critical. High-frequency trading firms and market makers depend on instantaneous market data to exploit arbitrage opportunities and hedge risks. DeFi protocols—decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and derivatives markets—require real-time prices to execute trades, maintain liquidity, and trigger liquidations fairly. Pyth’s direct connection to institutional data sources gives it an edge in security, accuracy, and speed, offering a critical infrastructure for on-chain financial products to operate with traditional capital market-grade data quality and speed.\n\nGaming and Esports:\n\nThe blockchain gaming and esports industries increasingly integrate tokenized assets, NFTs, and betting mechanisms that require timely data for fairness and user experience. Pyth’s millisecond data updates enable live odds, event outcomes, and in-game asset valuations to reflect real-world changes instantly. This creates a more immersive and trustworthy ecosystem for gamers and betters by preventing stale or manipulated data from impacting outcomes. The speed and tamper-resistant nature of Pyth’s oracles can underpin transparent, decentralized gaming marketplaces and prediction platforms.\nSupply Chain and Logistics\nModern supply chains leverage IoT sensors and smart contracts to monitor inventory, shipments, and environmental factors. Pyth’s rapid data transmission can enhance supply chain responsiveness by feeding real-time sensor data on location, temperature, or humidity directly into smart contracts. This enables automated decision-making such as rerouting shipments, activating contractual penalties for delays, or adjusting inventory levels dynamically. By incorporating Pyth’s oracle network, supply chain platforms can achieve greater transparency and efficiency in global trade flows.\n\nEnergy and Utilities:\n\nEnergy grids need to balance supply and demand continuously, a task made more complex by renewables like solar and wind that fluctuate rapidly. Pyth could provide low-latency weather data and sensor feeds to grid operators, enabling real-time adjustments in generation and distribution. This helps mitigate blackouts, optimize renewable usage, and integrate decentralized energy sources. The transparency and auditability of blockchain combined with Pyth’s fast oracles could also improve market operations in energy trading and decentralized utilities.\n\nSports Betting and Prediction Markets:\n\nIn sports betting and prediction markets, millisecond updates on event data, player stats, and odds determine fair pricing and reduce arbitrage risks. Pyth’s ability to deliver trusted, direct data feeds on-chain rapidly can revolutionize decentralized sports betting with fairer markets and real-time odds adjustments. This benefits both operators and bettors with enhanced market efficiency and reduced risk of manipulation or stale information.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles and IoT:\n\nThe emerging autonomous vehicle industry and IoT ecosystems require real-time sensor and environmental data to operate safely and efficiently. Pyth’s low-latency oracle feeds could deliver verifiable external inputs such as traffic data, weather conditions, and enterprise asset status directly to control systems or smart contracts managing automated processes. This would improve safety, reduce latency in decision-making, and create more efficient operational frameworks.\n\nIn conclusion, Pyth Network’s millisecond-level price and event data feeds provide a strong foundation for transforming a broad range of industries beyond DeFi. Its unique combination of speed, accuracy, security, and decentralized governance equips it to support new classes of applications that demand timely, reliable data integration. By tapping into finance, gaming, logistics, energy, betting, and IoT, Pyth can enable innovative business models, improved operational efficiencies, and greater transparency across sectors reliant on real-world data.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o8gnmj/pyth_network_industries/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Those investors aren’t sitting on the sidelines waiting to gamble. They’re chasing safe yield they can actually trust.\n\nSame mindset has already spilled into crypto. You can see it in how capital is moving right now. More people are parking stablecoins in places that earn: lending protocols, tokenized treasuries, on-chain credit markets.\n\nDeFi lending deposits have been growing faster than the overall crypto market cap. So even when prices stall, yield products are still pulling in capital.\n\nProjects like Ondo, Maple, and Aave are basically becoming crypto’s version of money markets. Tokenized treasuries, short-term credit, stablecoin pools. This is how yield-focused investors are dipping into crypto without even touching volatile assets.\n\nFeels like the early signs of maturity. The tools are getting cleaner, the risk frameworks are improving, and DeFi is starting to look less like a casino and more like an income engine.\n\nAll my crypto friends have stopped talking about meme coins and started obsessing over farming and yield opportunities. \n\nSo maybe the next bull run isn’t about wild speculation.

Data shared by CoinShares head of research, James Butterfill, shows that global crypto ETPs have attracted roughly $48.7 billion so far in 2025, beating last year’s $44.2 billion total. The momentum highlights growing institutional confidence and sustained interest in regulated crypto investment vehicles.\n\nThe surge builds on a massive $5.95 billion inflow recorded just last week, one of the largest weekly totals ever. Bitcoin continues to dominate, pulling in around $30 billion in new capital, though its share of the total is starting to slip as investors diversify beyond BTC. This shift suggests that institutional portfolios are gradually opening up to broader crypto exposure.\n\nEther and several altcoins like COAI on BNB chain have seen notable growth after exchanges support and  poolx during the same period, can't say if the btc pool on some like bitget before the new BTC ATH is still contributing to a more balanced inflow distribution across the market.

As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn’t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they’re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) – Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) – Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) – Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the “revenue” comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don’t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it’s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there’s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that’s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There’s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem’s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK &amp; Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.", "lang": null, "likes": 4, "replies": 14, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0s90f/deep_dive_into_nonbtc_dats/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients’ addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don’t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 17, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume.

The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 20, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Since then, we’ve:\n\n• Launched PineappleDEX Lite, and now rolled out the full PineappleDEX with CEX-grade limit orders\n\n• Continued to develop $PAPPLE utility, with stakers able to earn up to 15% APY, access to new token launches, and exclusive events. And soon, you’ll be able to spend $PAPPLE at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide\n\n• Integrated Solana, joining BNB, Ethereum, and Base, with many more chains to come\n\n• Opened Pineapple Mansion: our members-only ecosystem where top-tier stakers gain exclusive access to AMAs, private events, and luxury perks\n\n• Announced the first project launching through Pineapple Express (our community-first incubation and launchpad platform): a Harvard-backed team building the future of decentralized healthcare. Full details coming this Friday!\n\n• Partnered with Aaron Ramsey, ex-Arsenal, Juventus, and Welsh national team footballer with a global audience exceeding 2 billion across his channels and partnerships\n\n• Became the official exchange partner of Polaris, the fastest-growing combat sports league with hundreds of millions of viewers annually, and a presence on UFC Fight Pass\n\n• Brought on almost a dozen Conor McGregor-backed BKFC fighters as ambassadors, and even hosted a private yacht event for our top stakers and whales.\n\nWe’ve been called one of the most active and innovative teams in DeFi - not just in product delivery, but in partnerships, marketing, and community building.\n\nNow, we’re here to share what’s next - and trust me, there’s a lot just around the corner.

I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here’s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50–60% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about “supply shock” and “institutional demand.” Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the “smart money” and the “supply shock” narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that’s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that’s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn’t disappeared. It’s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that “the macro environment is too tough” doesn’t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn’t (only) the economy, it’s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That’s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and “institutional adoption” story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every “strong project” will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn’t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, “Is this really it?”\n\nIf ETH and alts don’t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won’t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto’s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic “BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; alts” rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don’t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "lang": null, "likes": 624, "replies": 579, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve been kicking this idea around for a while: if you were to launch your own crypto project from scratch, what would you actually do to give the coin real market value and not just pump-and-dump hype?\n\nMost new coins seem to follow the same tired playbook: spin up a catchy name, throw together a whitepaper, raise some money, list on a few DEXes, hope for a pump on Twitter, and then watch interest fade after a few weeks. That’s obviously not sustainable. I’m curious about the people here who think about the long game.\n\nIf you were in charge, how would you approach it? Would you focus on:\n\nUtility: A lot of coins die because they don’t do anything useful. Would you design it around a specific problem, maybe payments, gaming, privacy, DeFi, or something entirely different?\n\nTokenomics: Would you prioritize fair distribution, low inflation, or something like a burn mechanism to control supply? Maybe staking rewards to keep holders engaged?\n\nLiquidity &amp; Listings: We all know exchange access matters. Would you try to get on every CEX you can early on, or focus on building liquidity pools on DeFi first?\n\nCommunity: Some projects live or die by their community. Would you prioritize building an engaged user base first, think memes, community voting, regular updates or do you think community only matters once there’s actual utility?\n\nPartnerships &amp; Real-World Use: This is where I see a lot of coins fall short. Beyond airdrops and influencer shilling, what about partnerships with businesses or apps where the coin could actually be used?\n\nMarketing vs. Building: The classic debate: do you spend early energy on marketing hype to get people in the door, or quietly build and launch with a working product before going loud?\n\nPersonally, I think too many projects skip over the fundamentals. Everyone wants a moonshot chart, but few want to do the boring work: sustainable tokenomics, real-world use cases, proper liquidity strategy, and a solid long-term plan for how the token integrates into whatever ecosystem you’re building.\n\nSo I’m throwing it out to the community: if you were given the chance to create a new crypto from zero, how would you try to make it valuable over the next 5+ years?\n\nWhat’s the first thing you’d focus on?\nWhat’s the mistake you’d avoid at all costs?\nAny unconventional tactics that you think could really move the needle?", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 40, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwmddc/if_you_started_your_own_crypto_project_how_would/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Memecoins… I know what you’re probably thinking when you read that word. And yes, most of your preconceptions are correct. A large portion of this industry, especially when you consider the capital involved, revolves around pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nIn fact, I recently came across more than one confession on Reddit from self-proclaimed pump-and-dump operators. From organized KOL gangs to small-time celebrities, and even highly technical individuals with automated toolkits — most of them operate on Solana. And the majority use the **Pump\\[dot\\]fun** platform.\n\nOne Reddit user in particular, u/JewelTamexJuno, caught my attention because of the level of detail he revealed during an AMA. He also seemed to have a thinly veiled agenda of selling his own toolkit, which he described as including:\n\n* Volume bot\n* X tracker\n* AI API with his own LLM\n* Private RPC (likely a rented dedicated node)\n* New trader alert bot\n* Sniper bot\n\nAs anyone familiar with web3 will notice, none of this is groundbreaking. Some tools are even free or easy to adapt. Others cost just a few dollars. With less than $100, anyone could piece together a similar setup, even without coding skills — with a bit of effort, of course.\n\nHe even outlined his script, which goes something like this:\n\n* X trackers monitor large accounts (e.g., Elon, Presidents, major CT figures).\n* An account tweets an image (for example, Elon Musk posting a Doge on the moon).\n* His bot detects the image and instantly creates a memecoin around it, with AI generating the name.\n* He buys a chunk of the supply and runs volume bots.\n* Retail traders jump in.\n* He dumps.\n\nHe also dropped this gem of his wisdom:\n\n“*Everyone knows that newly created coins based on trends can rug at any time, making it a race for manual traders.*”\n\nThis is a snapshot of how one individual can manipulate the system — not because he’s a genius, but because the entire environment makes it possible. Beyond individuals, I also saw mob-like operations involving KOLs running secret Telegram groups, coordinating manual pumps, and creating ponzi-like subgroup structures where insiders grabbed the biggest slice. Again, not sophisticated — just organized extraction.\n\nAnd let’s not even start with celebrities and nation-state presidents orchestrating their own pump-and-dumps. We’ve seen enough to understand that the **Solana ecosystem is saturated with mafia-style groups and bot armies**, all dressed up as “fun” memecoins.\n\nBut are people really having fun? Is there anything authentic to this narrative, or is it just another layer of extractive nonsense?\n\n\\[This is small part of my article \"[Are you laughing?](https://substack.com/home/post/p-175103381) [The way to have fun with memecoins like a builder](https://substack.com/inbox/post/175103381?r=23szg&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&amp;triedRedirect=true)\" just click the link if you want to read the full story and discover one or two new things, but i REALLY want to start a discussion here, it's not a engagement/subscriber farming post.

In this education post, I will be exploring incentive platforms that provide additional rewards beyond standard yield farming approaches and how users can compound rewards. These platforms assist protocols in bootstrapping liquidity through boosted incentives, points, or campaigns, offering users improved returns with minimal added risk.\n\nI will be examining Merkl, Fuul, and Turtle.\n\nThis is NFA and before allocating to these protocols, you should DYOR.\n\nI am not financially compensated from the 3 protocols and do not have official relationships with them, I simply have used the protocols and had good experiences.\n\nOne big piece of alpha: none of the platforms have launched a token yet, but we know so many platforms eventually do drop a token. Early participation may qualify users for potential airdrops or rewards before saturation occurs. Merkl, Fuul, and Turtle.xyz currently have no live tokens, though Turtle announced $TURTLE on September 29, 2025, with launch details forthcoming. Merkl and Fuul have not indicated tokens publicly, but DeFi platforms often reward early users retroactively and engaging prior to announcements when competition is lower can be advantageous.\n\nPlatforms like these can be extremely lucrative, especially Turtle.xyz, by stacking multiple reward layers on stable or low-risk positions. I am personally using Turtle.xyz before the airdrop, farming stablecoins on Katana.  Turtle has a liquidity leaderboard and is airdropping to the top 1000 on their liquidity leaderboard, which currently requires just over $500.  No idea how much this will be worth on TGE, but if you’re already yield farming on TAC, Katana, or Linea, might as well pick up some free rewards.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: There are liquidity farming, incentive-as-a-service platforms that add incentives to attract TVL and give users increased yields. Early use may yield benefits from future token drops.\n\n**Platform Overviews**\n\nThese function as incentives-as-a-service tools, enabling protocols to run targeted campaigns for liquidity attraction. Users deposit or provide liquidity, receiving base yields plus additional points or rewards. This aids chains and apps in bootstrapping without rapid emission depletion, while expanding user compounding options.\n\n* Merkl: Backed by a16z, Merkl is an incentive and points management platform for custom campaigns across over 50 chains. It has distributed more than $200M in incentives, with partners including Aave, Compound, Katana, Morpho, Uniswap, Euler, and PancakeSwap. Integrations on Arbitrum and Optimism facilitate stacking rewards on lending or LP positions.\n* Fuul: Fuul offers tools for incentive programs paid in points or tokens. It has generated over $4B in trading volume from dYdX referrals, plus contributions to Vertex (30% of early trading volume) and Resolv. Partners include dYdX, Vertex, Resolv, Dune, Base, and Arbitrum. It supports no-code campaigns for trading, lending, and liquidity provisioning.\n* **Turtle.xyz**: Turtle.xyz routes deposits to partners through campaigns and a leaderboard. It has handled over $5B in liquidity and accumulated a multi-million-dollar treasury from contributions. Deposits are straightforward, with $524 currently sufficient for top 1000 leaderboard placement. Partners include Linea, Katana, Lombard, Etherfi, Renzo, Scroll, TAC, and over 30 others such as PancakeSwap and Swell. For BTCfi users, LBTC deposits on Katana earn Lux Points, potentially qualifying for $BARD airdrops, so you can basically triple-dip here.\n\n**Significance for DeFi Users**\n\nIn a competitive environment, these platforms enhance efficiency by aligning incentives. Protocols are willing to pay to gain increased TVL for growth, while users receive amplified returns. This creates a sustainable ecosystem dynamic. With no tokens launched yet (except Turtle's upcoming one), current involvement offers opportunities for retrospective rewards.\n\nFor DeFi users, this trend indicates that projects and chains are increasingly willing to pay extra through boosted incentives and campaigns to attract users and liquidity. This ultimately benefits participants with higher yields and airdrop qualifications. Users win.  \n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this is that institutions are also engaging with these platforms. For example, Turtle.xyz has attracted institutional investors like Susquehanna International Group, signaling a broader shift in TradFi's openness to onchain activities and integration with DeFi.\n\nThese developments reflect DeFi's maturation, where sophisticated incentive layers allow users to stack rewards across multiple protocols and chains, democratizing access to opportunities that were once limited to large players. This fosters greater innovation and competition among ecosystems, as chains vie for capital with structured campaigns rather than relying on volatile token emissions. For everyday users, it means more ways to optimize portfolios and combine base APYs with points, leaderboards, and potential airdrops.  These potentially compounded gains in a low-effort manner leads to better and better rewards. As institutional adoption grows, it could further stabilize liquidity pools and introduce new asset classes, pointing to a more resilient and expansive DeFi landscape overall.\n\nAdoption is increasing as protocols integrate these tools. For those farming yields, incorporating them can elevate APYs.\n\n\n\nAgain, this isn’t meant as financial advice, but more highlighting how defi users can improve their yield and gains through these incentive-as-a-service liquidity providing platforms.", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nunyq2/defi_education_liquidity_coordination_platforms/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve been looking at how consistently profitable traders operate and a lot of them DCA instead of timing entries. Makes sense: you smooth volatility and remove emotion.\n\nExecution is the interesting part. Most people use Coinbase or Kraken recurring buys...simple, but fees/spreads can add up. I’ve been using Jupiter on Solana for on-chain DCA: set an interval and it routes across DEXs for best price. Way more flexible than most CEX options. Downside: you need to manage SOL for gas and on-chain failures/alerts.\n\nTax reality (US): buying crypto with fiat is not a taxable event. Weekly DCA creates lots of purchases to track for basis, but you don’t have a taxable event until you dispose (sell/trade/spend). On-chain, the gas you pay in SOL is a small taxable disposal of that SOL at its FMV when paid. That’s minor per tx, but real.\n\nBecause DCA multiplies transactions, crypto tax software isn’t optional once volume rises. You’ll want clean lot tracking (Specific ID/HIFO if you can substantiate, otherwise FIFO), fee roll-in to basis, and exports that won’t wreck your 8949 when you eventually sell.\n\nawaken.tax pulls your CEX and wallets, links internal transfers, applies your chosen lot method, and produces clean Form 8949 exports so your DCA doesn’t turn into spreadsheet purgatory at filing time.\n\nMy current setup: weekly BTC/ETH buys, bi-weekly SOL via Jupiter for alts. Took ~30 minutes to configure; then it runs.\n\nAnyone else running DCA? What cadence are you using, and are you staying on CEX for simplicity or going on-chain for flexibility?

I've spent some time exploring their docs, blogs, and setup. \n\nTL;DR - It's a Layer-1 project focused on privacy and post-quantum security. It's still early, but very reminiscent of other privacy coins that started out with limited buzz but interesting innovation. \n\n# What Neptune Cash Is All About\n\nAt its core, Neptune Cash is a peer-to-peer anonymous cash protocol built as a Layer-1 blockchain. It uses zk-STARKs integrated right at the base layer, which means users handle transaction proofs on their end, miners aggregate everything into one big block with a single proof. This keeps the chain succinct and scalable without bloating.\n\nThe standout for me is the privacy aspect. Transactions are fully anonymous by default, using mutator sets (a fresh approach to zero-knowledge that maintains privacy with full verifiability). It's designed for fungible cash-like transfers, and it also supports private smart contracts with arbitrary logic. This means it can be used in DeFi or apps and your portfolio stays hidden. \n\nCompared to something like Monero, which relies on ring signatures, this setup feels more efficient for scaling while keeping things untraceable. A\n\nFor post-quantum security, it is baked in from the start. All the cryptography is resistant to quantum attacks, meaning future upgrades or risks of a supply shock if quantum computers advance stay off the table. Neptune is quantum-secure at genesis, which is different than other projects where they would fix the quantum problem through forking the chain with the patch upgrades. This approach which positions Neptune for long-term usage in a world where privacy tech faces bigger threats down the line.\n\n# The Team Behind It\n\nAlan Szepieniec serves as the lead researcher. He holds a PhD in post-quantum cryptography from the University of Leuven in Belgium, works as a researcher at the Nervos Foundation, and founded AS Discrete Mathematics GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. He has authored numerous scientific papers, with key contributions including DARK/Supersonic (SNARKs without trusted setups using novel mathematics) and Rescue &amp; Rescue-Prime (hash functions widely adopted for zero-knowledge proofs). \n\nThorkil Værge is the other founder. He holds an MSc in Physics from the University of Copenhagen and brings over seven years of experience in blockchain technology. He has contributed to the specifications of the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin Lightning Network, built core blockchain implementations for companies like BitGo, Bitcoin Suisse, and Inacta, and created a compiler for specifying financial contracts on Ethereum.\n\nSuper a research-heavy team, with the project representing five years of dedicated R&amp;D. This project took a long time to ship, but personally, I appreciate the dedication to solid technical achievements.\n\n# Tokenomics and Mechanics\n\nToken is $NPT, with a total supply capped at 42 million – similar to Bitcoin's model but with tweaks. Halvings every three years, starting from 128 per block. Half of mining rewards are locked for three years, which aligns miners with long-term holding rather than quick actions. Premine is under 2%, and the design is deflationary over time.\n\nMining is Proof-of-Work, but memory-hard (needs about 40GB RAM for efficiency), which levels the field against botnets and ASICs. It got hit by a botnet early on (common issue for PoW chains), leading to a relaunch in August 2025 with the upgraded algo. Now it's more decentralized and resistant. If you're into mining, it's CPU/GPU friendly. The adoption is low and growing organically, like early privacy coins where miners were the first users.\n\n# Ways to participate\n\nAfter the AMA, I set up a node and wallet to poke around. Here's the practical side:\n\n* Wallet and Node: Download the core software from their GitHub (neptune-core). It's CLI-based for now – run commands to generate a wallet and sync the chain. Syncing is fast thanks to the recursive proofs; validating the whole history is basically instant.\n* Mining: If you want to try, install the core, configure your wallet, and point it at a pool or solo mine. Their docs cover it – it's straightforward if you're used to PoW setups. Usage is still early, but contributors are popping up because the tech is appealing for privacy-focused builds.\n* Acquiring $NPT: Only on SafeTrade right now (NPT-USDT pair). Liquidity is thin, so limit orders are key to avoid slippage. DEX is on the roadmap.\n* Resources: YouTube is great for explainers &amp; the explorer lets you view blocks without revealing privacy details.\n\nFrom what I've seen, adoption is in that bootstrapping phase. Usage starting with miners and devs but showing a lot of promise. Privacy and future-proofing are the core strengths, and it's worth exploring. I've learned a ton just setting it up.

A couple months ago, Teller ran AMA on this subreddit and since then it’s become one of the protocols I use the most.\n\nBullet points on features I like\n\n* TellerGPT – Amazing for DeFi users. I don't know why every platform doesn't do this. I get a daily email with live pool conditions, yields, and borrowing options. It saves me a ton of time since I don’t have to check every dashboard on the platoform and  can just scan my inbox and know where the best opportunities are.\n* Incentivized supply side yields – So I am a big time katana user. Right now I’m earning \\~25% APY on a couple assets (USDC &amp; POL) simply by supplying the asset. The rewards are in-kind which is also really nice and avoids the BS that a lot of other lending protocols use.  The incentives make supplying compelling because the yield scales with borrowing demand, and it’s single-asset so I don’t deal with impermanent loss.\n* No direct liquidations – This is a massive differentiator. On Aave, Morpho, Compound, etc, if your collateral value drops too much, you get liquidated. This means is you're close to to your max LTV, you're constantly chart watching and nervous.  But with Teller, loans run on 30-day checkpoints, meaning as long as you pay the interest, your position stays open. If you miss the checkpoint, collateral goes into a Dutch auction where users bid on the collateral to reimburse the lenders. It’s way less stressful and lets you ride out volatility without getting wrecked by a random wick.\n\nThe last point is why Teller feels different to me. Aave, Morpho, and Compound are great, but they’re designed around constant price-based liquidations. Teller flips that model with checkpoint-based loans, and in my opinion, it’s a much better fit for more advanced strategies.\n\nTo me, Teller is perfect for a DeFi-first heavy user as it's designed more for long-term lending &amp; borrowing strategies. \n\nA 30-day checkpoint is a really unique way to solve the high LTV problem in defi. Longer term, I think this model is set up well for on-chain credit systems once ZK-identity becomes more standard, as wallets can have credit scores attached to real identities (but obscured through zk-identity) meaning better borrowing terms for credible borrowers.  \n\nDisclaimer: NFA &amp; I wouldn’t recommend someone brand new to DeFi to dive in.

Just saw this coin the day before yesterday and bought at $1.7 I sold at $2.1 and made a 50 dollar profit. Recently, I’ve been thinking of changing strategy. My portfolio is 85-90% Litecoin (already sold my BTC, BNB, ETH, and SOL to buy Litecoin) because I think it’s pretty solid (commodity, fixed supply, fast, MWEB, treasuries, soon ETF, and most important, cheap). I’m of the philosophy of selling the winners to buy the losers because it’s easier for a 10B marketcap coin to double than it is for Bitcoin to do the same in the same timeframe. I think many people agree with this (otherwise, memecoins wouldn’t be so popular) and also that PoW coins with a fixed supply that have stayed in the market for more than a decade are solid investments. Unfortunately, my thesis proved wrong because LTC has underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, I’m not selling it this cheap and have already holded it from $50 to $114 to $50 to $140 to $70 to now. So I’ll just stay invested there. \n\nMy question though, is about the remaining 15% of my porftolio. My best investment was Injective which I bought with $500 (less than 1% of my portfolio) because I liked the logo and it did a 100x from $1 to $53. Following the same train of thought, I bought OSMO (a Cosmos coin) with part of the profits from INJ but it was the WORST investment. It’s breaking all time lows every day. It’s sitting at a 100M marketcap and I fear it will be delisted or the developers may abandon the project and leave it to die. I’m not a fan of selling coins cheap but I already lost faith in the coin because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or even Solana, it’s not of interest to any institution and doesn’t seem to have a floor. I was thinking of selling the OSMO to buy ASTER at $1.7.\n\nAster is pretty high in marketcap so in theory it’s harder to make a profit but a big marketcap can also be a positive because the coin has “proven itself” (psychology) and, most important, it’s backed by CZ. If he’s promoting it so much, it feels like a legit project. I don’t trust Binance with my life but the guy sent BNB from 10 cents to 1K and has built a crypto empire. I think $ASTER is here to stay and could double this year, if not more. And even if the bear market comes, I think it would drop less than OSMO. \n\nWhat do you guys think, should I pull the trigger and buy ASTER? Are you buying at these prices? Or are you out already? Or do you think it’s not a good project and better to just buy gold or have USDT? I need to make a 2X to recover my losses from OSMO.

On September 29 we launch Season 0, where we bootstrap network liquidity and align before the ICO. Ask us anything now and find out how to make the most of Season 0 before we go live on Sept 29.\n\n**What is Makina and why is it relevant to the sub?**  \nMakina is a DeFi Execution Engine that connects professional strategists (Operators) with onchain users through programmable vaults called Machines. The first Operator that will deploy on Makina will be Dialectic, an industry-leading crypto-native fund.Machines are designed for institutional-grade yield strategies that anyone with a wallet can access. Risk management is enforced onchain with pre-approved instructions, parameter caps, atomic unwinds, and a lot of other innovative tech.\n\nThis is relevant to the sub because it tackles issues that matter in DeFi today: yield, transparency, risk management, fair launches, and execution infrastructure.\n\n**What’s happening now?**  \nOn September 29 at 12:00 UTC we launch Season 0. This is your chance to acquire Machine Tokens (MT) and participate in Makina’s launch while earning:\n\n\\- Base yield from selected Morpho vaults (Steakhouse USDC, MEV Capital WETH, Gauntlet WBTC Core).\n\n\\- Tickets: Tickets give priority ICO access at $35M FDV (the same valuation as our strategic angel round).\n\n\\- Points: Points convert to $MAK tokens at TGE + leaderboard perksSeason 0 runs for 4 weeks. Early participation brings higher reward boosts. Your boost depends on when you join and how you position your Machine Tokens.\n\n**Why are we here?**  \nWe want to share details of how Season 0 works, explain why institutional-grade execution infrastructure is missing from today’s DeFi stack, and hear directly from the r/cryptocurrency community.\n\n**Topics we’d love to dive into (but not limited to):**\n\n\\- Mechanics of Makina’s Season 0, Tickets, Points, ICO, and Boosts.\n\n\\- What makes Makina uniquely positioned to transform DeFi operations? \n\n\\- Makina’s technical innovations.\n\n\\- Risk frameworks and Operator alignment.\n\n\\- How fair launch values shape the $MAK distribution.\n\n\\- The role of Machines in scaling cross-chain strategies.\n\n\\- What comes next after Season 0?\n\n*Season 0 is just the start.

Tokenized US Treasury products have surged since early 2024 and are now roughly an ~$9 billion market depending on the tracker you look at. Some datasets frame it as a ~50x move from a very small base, while broader trackers show it was already closer to the ~$1B range in early 2024, so the multiple depends on what’s included. Either way, the direction is the same: big growth in a short time.\n\nBlackRock's BUIDL fund is leading the pack at around ~$1.7B in assets. Its basically short-term US government bonds that you can hold and settle onchain with daily yield. Other big players include Circle's USYC, Superstate's USTB and Ondo Finance's OUSG. All of them offering tokenized access to government debt through regulated structures.\n\nThe reason this matters is because US Treasury bills are perfect for bringing traditional finance onto blockchain. You get the safety of government backing combined with blockchain settlement efficiency. Plus institutions can use these as collateral for other activities which improves capital efficiency.\n\nMajor banks are already testing this stuff. DBS which is Southeast Asia's largest bank has piloted tokenized products and talked about using tokenized assets in institutional workflows like collateral management. This isnt some DeFi experiment anymore, its actual institutional infrastructure being built.\n\nThe timing makes sense too. With interest rates being higher than they've been in years, these products are offering decent yield compared to just holding stablecoins. And institutions get all the benefits of blockchain settlement without taking on crypto market risk.\n\nAnd as more portfolios hold yield-bearing assets on-chain...often across multiple wallets, chains, and structures...the operational side starts to matter too. Tracking yield, redemptions, and tax treatment across these instruments is where tools like Awaken Tax quietly become relevant, especially for funds and active investors managing both crypto-native and tokenized TradFi exposure.\n\nThis is basically tradfi and crypto merging in real time. When you see billions flowing into tokenized treasuries while the broader crypto market is struggling, it shows theres serious institutional demand for blockchain infrastructure even if they're not buying Bitcoin or ETH directly.

Traditional finance players are trying to force-fit legacy infrastructure onto blockchain rails.

Real institutions need 24/7 markets (not just crypto market hours), atomic settlement (not T+2), and significantly lower costs than what TradFi offers.\n\nBeen following a project called Sphinx Protocol that's trying to tackle this for commodity derivatives specifically (oil, gas, futures, options). They raised $2M pre-seed back in June and are currently in their pre-testnet phase with mainnet supposedly coming later next year. The angle is building a permissioned L1 specifically for energy commodities with institutional compliance baked in from day one, not bolted on after.\n\nWhat caught my eye is they're claiming 10x lower fees and 28% better capital efficiency vs traditional exchanges, plus atomic settlement. Big promises obviously, and ngl I'm skeptical until testnet actually drops, but at least someone's trying to build proper infrastructure instead of just another token wrapper. If blockchain can't dramatically improve the actual trading infrastructure and just becomes another wrapper for the same old system, what's the point?

The next near-term milestone is a Senate committee markup in January (per White House crypto czar David Sacks), but Brandt’s saying it’s not gonna be “world-shaking” for BTC.\n\nHis take is pretty straightforward. Yeah the regulation is needed and will be good for the industry overall, but having an asset get regulated isnt some earth-shattering event. Especially when alot of Bitcoin maxis never wanted regulation in the first place. He thinks it’ll clarify the regulatory structure which is positive but wont redefine Bitcoin’s value.\n\nJohn Glover from Ledn agrees and says the Clarity Act has already been priced into the market. Any benefits to price action would be more delayed over time as Bitcoin and ETH gain broader acceptance as investable assets. So dont expect fireworks on day one.\n\nThe more interesting part is Brandt’s price prediction. He believes Bitcoin is currently in a bear market and could trade down to $60,000 in Q3 2026. Thats a 31% drop from current levels around $88,000. He says the charts are suggesting this move but his downside bias is “moderate” because of stuff like the Clarity Act providing some support.\n\nSenator Cynthia Lummis has been pushing hard to advance the bill and mentioned the crypto industry was getting concerned about progress since drafts kept changing during bipartisan discussions. The bill addresses digital asset market structure which is important long-term even if it doesnt create immediate price action.\n\nAnd honestly, if the vibe shifts from “number go up” to “rules + reporting,” that’s where people get caught off guard. Not because regulation instantly pumps price, but because it nudges more activity onto cleaner rails. If you’re actively trading or doing DeFi, it’s also the moment where keeping your cost basis straight matters more than ever, and tools like Awaken tax become less “nice to have” and more “please don’t let me guess my taxes.”\n\nSo basically temper your expectations if you’re expecting the Clarity Act to moon Bitcoin.", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pr4fh7/peter_brandt_says_clarity_act_wont_move_bitcoins/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

I learned about Ethereum in 2017 and started building dapps shortly after. Both technologies felt like game changers. Over time, I lost hope in Ethereum. First it was issues with high fees and a congested network. Then the L2s came and gave some hope. But the whole ecosystem is a mess.\n\nI invested in Polkadot a while ago. So long ago that I paid over $20 for each DOT. As a dev, I wanted to learn about building on Polkadot but found it totally overwhelming. So my attention drifted away. Earlier this year I saw Doom running on JAM and knew I needed to see what what going on.\n\nI took the PBAX course and started learning about Polkadot. Wow. They are so far ahead of Ethereum and their roadmap is bright and shiny. I'm still learning about JAM, which is sort of an abstraction of parts of Polkadot upon which any blockchain networks can run. And it's technically as powerful as a super computer.\n\nThere are now more active developers in the Polkadot space than in the Ethereum space. The way I figure it, most people won't care about why Polkadot is important until developers start to produce applications. And it seems a giant herd of developers are moving in exactly that direction right now. I'm learning INK myself with plans to port an old project over. And I don't really expect anyone who's in the scene just to invest and make money to notice until late next year. And then - I think it's going to explode.\n\nI have moved about 80% of my ETH holdings to DOT, which is trading close to $2 now.

Here's why \"just HODL\" is terrible advice I've been in crypto since 2018. I'm a developer, not a trader. That distinction cost me nearly a million dollars in unrealized gains.\n\n**The setup**\n\nStarted with ETH in 2018. As a dev, I participated in grants and hackathons. Then I discovered Stacks (back when it was Blockstack) and joined their App Mining program.\n\nThe program paid well. Really well. Enough-to-retire well.\n\nBut I didn't cash out enough. I held most of it.\n\n**The delusion**\n\nStacks has this mechanism where you stack STX to earn BTC. Sounds amazing, right? Passive income in Bitcoin just for holding.\n\nI watched STX go from $0.12 to $3.70. Sold a bit here and there, but never enough.\n\nWhy would I sell more? I was earning BTC. The number kept going up. I felt like a genius.\n\n**Going deeper**\n\nFeeling invincible, I went further:\n\n* NFTs\n* Memecoins (the usual dogs and cats)\n* DeFi farming\n* Liquidity pools\n\nThen I discovered ALEX Protocol. High yields. The ALEX token was pumping too. I thought I'd found the compound effect holy grail.\n\nSo I reinvested everything. STX, ALEX, more memecoins. All in.\n\n**The first crash**\n\nALEX got hacked.\n\nLost almost $500k overnight.\n\nBut I'm a dev, right? I built a trading app (basically a pumpfun clone on Stacks) and clawed back some losses. STX pumped to $3 again.\n\nDid I take real profits this time? Did I learn?\n\nNo.\n\n**The second crash**\n\nSTX is now $0.30. Portfolio sitting at $100k.\n\nFrom $1M peak to $100k. A 90% drawdown.\n\n**What I lost**\n\nNot just money. Years of work. The App Mining earnings. The hackathon prizes. The grants. Most of it evaporated because I couldn't bring myself to sell enough.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n1. **Don't fall into the \"passive income\" or \"HODL to earn\" trap.** Staking rewards, yield farming, earning BTC by holding—it all sounds great until you realize you're just watching your principal bleed while collecting crumbs. Just sell and take profits.\n2. **Never trust any single founder or protocol.** They can die, go to jail, get hacked, or rug. Doesn't matter how famous they are.\n3. **Diversify.** Not just across tokens—across asset classes entirely.\n4. **Buy real assets.** Property. Index funds. Things that exist outside your browser wallet.\n5. **HODL is a meme, not a strategy.** It's copium for people who can't make decisions.\n\n\n\nI'm still building in crypto.

His advice is deceptively simple,“Buy the fear, sell the greed.” This mantra reflects the cyclical nature of crypto markets, where sentiment often swings wildly between panic and euphoria. CZ stresses that disciplined strategies like dollar cost averaging (DCA) and risk management are far more effective than chasing short term hype.\n\nThe recent Crazy 48h Event provided a perfect case study of this philosophy. Traders witnessed extreme volatility across multiple phases, Liquidity surged, shorts were liquidated en masse, and Bitcoin briefly spiked before retracing. Now phase 5 is live, those who had accumulated during earlier fearful phases were rewarded, while latecomers who chased the rally found themselves caught in the reversal. It was a textbook example of CZ’s principle in action.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Bitget hosted the event, giving traders worldwide a front row seat to the chaos. The most effective Bitcoin strategy is to stay disciplined and avoid emotional trading. Bitcoin has historically rewarded long term holders, so treating it as a strategic allocation rather than a quick trade is key.\n\nAt the same time, risk management is critical. Keep Bitcoin as a reasonable portion of your portfolio, avoid leverage, and remember that regulation and sentiment shifts can cause sharp swings. Think of Bitcoin as digital gold, so accumulate steadily, hold through cycles, and let patience, not greed, drive your returns.\n\nBitcoin’s long term trajectory is built on fundamentals, not hype.

He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work.

Their research team is pointing to improving liquidity and markets pricing in about a 92% chance of a Fed rate cut at the December 9–10 meeting. As of December 4th the odds of a rate cut jumped to 92%, which has often been supportive for risk assets like crypto in past cycles. They're also tracking global money supply which has been expanding lately.\n\nBack in October Coinbase actually predicted weakness in November followed by a December reversal and so far that's playing out. Bitcoin is hovering around $90k after dropping from highs near $100k last month.\n\nHowever the big wildcard is Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the rate decision press conference. Analysts say if Powell sounds hawkish about 2026 policy it could put a cap on any rally even if they cut rates. His previous hawkish remarks in November contributed to the selloff we just saw.\n\nMarket sentiment is still pretty fearful right now. Both institutional and retail investors are hesitant to jump back in which is keeping markets in limbo. The technical picture shows Bitcoin already retested the $80k area and bounced off support tho.\n\nOne positive catalyst is speculation that Kevin Hassett might become the next Fed Chair in 2026. He's seen as way more dovish which would be bullish for crypto long term.\n\nSo basically the setup looks decent for a December recovery but everyones gonna be watching what Powell says super closely.

Among the most notable changes are optimizations to block processing, more efficient state management, and refinements to Ethereum’s execution layer all designed to deliver noticeably faster transaction speeds and lower latency for users and developers.\n\nThe upgrade also lays foundational improvements for future scalability initiatives, including upcoming roadmap items tied to proto-danksharding and long-term data-availability solutions.

Between November 24 and December 2nd we saw three massive moves. JPMorgan filed to launch leveraged products tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. Nasdaq proposed to quadruple the limits on Bitcoin ETF options from 250,000 to 1 million contracts. Then Vanguard, who always said no to crypto, suddenly reversed course and opened Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs to their \\~50 million clients on a platform that oversees around $11 trillion.\n\nThis is wild because Vanguard's leadership was publicly against Bitcoin ETFs just last year. Now they’re effectively offering access to spot Bitcoin exposure to tens of millions of investors. Bank of America is letting 15,000 financial advisors recommend Bitcoin starting January 2026 with allocations between 1 to 4 percent of portfolios.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the timing. This all happened while retail investors were panic selling and getting rekt. Institutions basically waited for retail to capitulate then swooped in with their infrastructure fully built out. Sovereign wealth funds like Abu Dhabi Investment Council increased their Bitcoin positions as regular people were exiting.\n\nBut here’s the catch – while institutions are embracing Bitcoin through ETFs and derivatives, index providers like MSCI are simultaneously trying to exclude companies like Strategy that buy Bitcoin directly for their treasuries. MSCI proposed removing these companies from major indices, which would force them out of a lot of passive funds.\n\nso bitcoin is getting institutionalized but mainly through fee generating products that banks and asset managers control. the original model of companies holding bitcoin directly on balance sheets is facing obstacles, while ETF models that generate recurring revenue for financial firms are getting pushed hard.\n\nif you’re actually trying to see how that shows up in your own taxes and portfolio (ETFs vs holding btc / eth outright) messing around with something like awaken tax is way more useful than doomscrolling headlines ngl it at least forces you to see how your “btc exposure” is split between fee products and actual coins.\n\nBitcoin was supposed to work around the traditional system but now it’s basically being absorbed into it.\n\nThoughts on this shift?", "lang": null, "likes": 326, "replies": 81, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pdp9wf/bitcoin_just_got_completely_absorbed_by/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

This marks the moment when **crypto and blockchain officially enter the balance sheets of Wall Street**, bringing about true mass adoption—not through a bottom-up de-central-bank revolution, but a **top-down financial infrastructure upgrade**.\n\nRetail traders are like the tide; institutions are the sea.  \nThe tide retreats. The sea does not.\n\n# Reviewing 2025: The \"First Year of Institutions\n\n* **Inflow Source:** Almost all major capital flowing into **BTC/ETH** in 2025 came from institutions (67% of allocation), not retail. Retail traders focused on meme/altcoins.\n* **Key Drivers:** The explosion of **ETFs** (holding 5.7%–7.4% of circulating BTC supply) monopolized Bitcoin's primary inflow routes.\n* **Market Formation:** Low tradable supply (due to ETF custody) combined with continuous institutional buying created a **liquidity-shock bull market**.\n* **Institutional Catalyst:** **U.S. regulatory clarity** (stablecoin laws, ETF approvals) enabled legal, compliant, and scaled institutional entry to meet massive demand (estimated 80:1 demand-supply ratio for BTC).\n\n# The Trillion-Dollar Impact\n\n* **Financial Scale:** Institutions control 70–80% of the $600T+ global investable assets. A mere **1% portfolio reallocation** from this pool could **double BTC's market cap** (trillions of dollars).\n* **Core Narrative:** This shift makes **Real World Assets (RWA)** the core narrative of the next cycle.\n\n# Long-Term Roles of Major Assets\n\n* **BTC:** Becomes the **Digital Gold** and an institutional reserve asset, driving slow, trend-driven price movements.\n* **ETH:** Becomes the **\"Equity Asset\"** of the global on-chain economy, valued based on network scale and usage, offering staking yield (dividends).\n\n# Opportunity &amp; Strategy Shift\n\n* **Retail's New Role:** Retail transitions from **narrative makers to price followers**. Strategies must shift from emotion/short-term speculation to **following major structural flows** and cross-cycle investing.\n* **Key Growth Sectors (VCs &amp; Founders):**\n   1. **Enterprise/Institutional Blockchains:** Private, compliant chains (like Hyperledger) for bank settlement and pensions.\n   2. **Bridging + ZK:** Essential for connecting private enterprise chains with public chains (RWA ↔️ public crypto).\n   3. **Custody &amp; Asset-Management Tools:** Platforms like Fireblocks and Copper.\n   4. **RWA &amp; Settlement Layers:** Tokenizing Treasuries, private credit, and creating on-chain SWIFT equivalents.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The next bull market is an **upgrade to the global financial system**, not a revolution. Retail influence on major-coin prices will hit all-time lows. Success for retail means **understanding capital logic** and positioning for structural, enterprise-driven infrastructure trends.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 7, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pcuxtc/retail_is_dead_institutions_will_rise/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Also while there are no technical dependencies between Bitcoin and all those alt coins, there is actually super-strong dependency and everyone can see how precisely all altcoins copy bitcoin (with exception here or there). This is a clear evidence of still speculative component in price, and very little value. If trust in bitcoin shakes, whole industry shakes - a dominantly trust based “asset class” as the real use and value still needs to be developed. \n\nBut what about that cycle, which seems to be broken now? \n\nIMO the cycle was kind of convention created by bitcoin community - and it was passed on newcomers. Since it is all mostly based on trust, this convention was kind of guide in terms of where we are - is it good to buy, enter or sell? It worked somehow. Also part of this cycle were those waves or sequence:\n\n1. Cash BTC\n2. Pump and dump ether\n3. Pump and dump altcoin1-n \n\nAll was like a scripted game which helped to navigate.\n\nBut this “seasonality” does not exist on WallStreet and in Fin industry at all. The speculation there is omnipresent but most assets have underlying value - commodities are best example and events affecting underlying value is what drives price movements adjusted by speculation and trading approaches. \n\nSo once these big institutional players went into bitcoin, many applauded as price went up. However “kids game/convention” was effectively broken as these guys do not follow some convention, cycle etc. They came with their very own rules!  \n\nIMO they did not join this game just to pump and dump massively this asset and “destroy” further adoption potential. \nTheir strategy is more long term and less about that massive volatility. They dont like huge crashes. IMO it is these guys who protected price from “cyclic crash” which they did not join, they bought the dips triggered by retailers etc. \n\nSo the game changed. That is my opinion, but I keep hearing those who still think all is the same and they rule the game - they believe in classic cycle, which is not reality any more IMO. \n\nSo folks, is my reasoning flawed or how do you see that?", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pbhuqz/crypto_cycle_rationale/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Bitcoin dropped over 5% and was trading around $86,435, while Ethereum slid more than 6% to roughly $2,843. The weakness wasn’t limited to the top two coins. Solana fell more than 7%, and broader altcoins followed the same trend Dogecoin slipped nearly 9%. The pressure extended to Asia as well, after the People’s Bank of China issued a warning about illegal digital currency activity, pulling down several Hong Kong–listed crypto-linked stocks. Market sentiment remains risk-off, and analysts say a large chunk of the move appears tied to liquidations. Ben Emons of Fedwatch Advisors told CNBC that a roughly $400 million exchange liquidation was a major driver of Monday’s downturn. He also pointed to the extremely high leverage still present on crypto exchanges, with some platforms offering up to 200x leverage. According to Emons, the amount of perpetual futures leverage outstanding estimated around $787 billion dwarfs ETF-linked exposure, and leaves the market vulnerable to more forced selling if prices remain weak. Bitcoin’s behavior continues to show stronger correlation with tech indexes, especially the Nasdaq, something that became obvious during October’s market slide. Emons also highlighted that the current environment is heavily driven by retail traders, which typically adds more volatility and faster reactions during sell-offs. Broader macro uncertainty isn’t helping either.

That band usually lines up with funds, desks and more “professional” money. Historically when these guys stop pressing the buy button for a while it hasn’t been a great vibe for price later.\n\nThe spooky part is it looks a lot like 2021. Back then the same wallet range cooled off on accumulation and a few months later we slid into a proper bear market. Not saying copy paste crash incoming but it’s one of those signals you don’t just ignore.\n\nBut there’s a twist here. After that December nuke where institutions dumped around 79,000 BTC and we got hit with roughly a 15% correction, some of the bigger players actually started buying back in. Over the last 30 days or so they’ve scooped up something like 34,000 BTC again which means at least some whales think these levels are decent entry or reload zones.\n\nSo on one side you’ve got those mid sized 100–1,000 BTC wallets acting cautious and on the other side you’ve got larger institutional guys quietly stacking the dip. The pause from the mid tier whales feels like weaker medium term demand but the bigger wallets stepping in should add some kind of floor underneath.\n\nThe annoying part is retail is still basically asleep. Most of this is just big wallets and structured money slapping each other around so price action feels less like a classic cycle and more like a liquidity game.\n\nAre whales positioning for something big or just managing risk after a crazy run up hard to say for sure but these mixed signals are definitely worth keeping an eye on", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 31, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pav3z5/are_bitcoin_whales_actually_hesitating_right_now/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Bitcoin is having one of its worst Novembers since the 2018 bear market and here’s why it’s happening.\n\nSo far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.\n\nHistorically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.\n\nSince those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.\n\nAnother huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.\n\nSome analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.\n\nOne interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks", "lang": null, "likes": 43, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1p9ecgc/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

A trader that on chain analyst The Data Nerd spotted just opened a massive BTC long on Hyperliquid.... about $84.19 million with 3x leverage. That’s not pocket change, that’s serious conviction that Bitcoin is heading up.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the timing. Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon. The position uses leverage too, which means the gains could be huge but so could the losses if things go south.\n\nThe market has definitely been heating up. Daily BTC trading volume is in the high tens of billions of dollars right now, so there’s clearly a lot of activity and interest. Between whales, derivatives and bigger players still taking directional bets, there’s plenty of fuel for more volatility in both directions.\n\nThese kinds of whale moves usually create ripple effects.

This hybrid rollout allows investors to choose between the traditional fund and the blockchain based version recorded directly on Ethereum.\n\nThe first transaction was successfully executed on November 4, demonstrating that tokenized shares can coexist alongside traditional structures. The move reflects growing interest in leveraging blockchain for liquidity, transparency, and more flexible trading options.\n\nThe rollout was developed with CACEIS, a European asset servicing group, which provided the necessary tokenization infrastructure, investor wallets, and a digital order system to process subscriptions and redemptions. According to the companies, this setup helps streamline operations and widens access to new investor channels.\n\nTokenization also opens the door to 24/7 trading of traditionally static assets. Investors now have the ability to engage with money market funds in ways previously impossible, potentially increasing efficiency and broadening participation in a historically conservative segment. Platforms like bitget have also been experimenting with copy trading via GetAgent, allowing users to mirror strategies and trade tokenized or onchain assets, providing a parallel example of how blockchain tools are bridging traditional and crypto finance.

If key support levels fail (80K), the primary downtrend could resume.\n2. **The Role of Extreme Sentiment:** We know that when market sentiment becomes extremely negative and everyone gives up hope, that's often when a major **Bullish Reversal** occurs, and the market starts its journey toward a new All-Time High (ATH). This situation is commonly referred to as **\"Blood in the streets.\"**\n\n# The Current State: Neither Bull Nor Bear?\n\nRight now, I don't see the kind of extreme negative sentiment that would confirm we've hit the final bottom. There is some Fear, but not the widespread Panic or Despair needed for a massive reversal.\n\n* **The Market's Next Move:** After this rally, the price will likely enter a **Sideways Consolidation** phase.\n* **The Deciding Factor:** This consolidation period will be the key to determining whether we get **Bull Continuation** or **Bear Trend Continuation**.

Bitcoin is seeing renewed selling pressure after on-chain data showed over $7.5 billion worth of whale inflows moving into Binance over the last 30 days. These are large BTC deposits from wallets that typically hold long-term and when they start moving coins onto exchanges, it usually means one thing: they want liquidity. What’s catching attention is how closely this looks to March 2025, when a similar wave of whale deposits hit exchanges. Within weeks, BTC dropped from around $102K to $70K as selling pressure picked up. This current inflow trend is almost identical in size and pace. On-chain analysts are pointing out a few red flags: Exchange liquidity is rising, which makes big sell orders easier to execute. Spot trading volume is thinning, so whales have more influence over price swings. Derivative markets are cutting long exposure, showing a shift toward caution. Long-term holder supply is falling, meaning older coins are moving out of storage usually not a bullish sign. The $7.5B figure is now one of the largest 30-day inflows of the year, and if this pace continues, it could point to a broader risk-off setup. But to be fair, this doesn’t guarantee a crash whales also move funds for hedging, collateral, or arbitrage.

That peak-to-trough move of roughly one third has been described by BeinCrypto as the steepest pullback of this bull cycle so far, and you can feel the uncertainty in the way people are trading.\n\nSome on-chain and technical analysts are arguing that, despite how nasty this correction has been, the broader uptrend from the past year and a half is still intact. They’re basically framing this as a classic bull market pullback – ugly in the short term, but still within the kind of drawdowns we saw in previous cycles before new highs.\n\nThe other camp is more cautious. Bitcoin has run straight into resistance in this low-90k area and stalled. If buyers can’t step in soon and turn this into a clean higher low, there’s a real chance we end up retesting the recent lows down in the low-80k region – and a decisive break below 80k is exactly the kind of level some analysts have warned could accelerate selling.\n\nA lot of traders are starting to treat this as a potential range rather than a straight trend. The idea is something like: resistance up around the low-90s, support down near the prior lows, and opportunities only at the extremes – fade euphoria near the top of the range and bid fear near the bottom – until the macro picture or flows force a real breakout.\n\nThe problem is that short term players are going to get wrecked whichever way it eventually breaks. If price squeezes above the current resistance, anyone who’s been shorting every lower high gets steamrolled. If we lose those low-80s supports, all the “buy every dip” crowd gets dragged into a much deeper drawdown than they signed up for.\nEvery squeeze and flush you play now turns into a cluster of taxable disposals later. I have been running my exchanges and wallets through awaken.tax just to see what my year actually looks like if I keep scalping this range instead of being surprised at filing time.\n\nRight now it feels like a waiting game. Macro data and the next Fed decision are hanging over everything, liquidity is thinner than it was near the top, and volatility is sleeping just enough to make people overconfident. Whether this turns into a proper higher-low reset or the start of a larger unwind probably depends less on the next meme line on the chart and more on whether real spot and ETF demand actually shows up again.", "lang": null, "likes": 32, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1p89llv/how_btc_fluctuations_are_puzzling_traders_as_btc/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

It basically shifts from being seen as a crisis hedge to more of a growth asset depending on where we are in the cycle.\n\nLooking back at 2013 to 2015 after Bitcoins first major pump inflation declined globally and BTC went into this long consolidation phase. People started talking about it as digital gold but price action was pretty boring.

This time Bitcoin stopped acting like an inflation hedge and became way more sensitive to liquidity and rate expectations. ETFs came into play institutional money started flowing and it shifted into a macro sensitive growth asset. if you look at actual realized gains and tax data over these years (the kind of stuff tools like awaken tax try to surface) you can literally see that most people end up realising big btc profits after rate cut vibes start, not at the peak panic.\n\nThe pattern is pretty clear. When inflation cools the urgent need for protection fades. Instead people start favoring assets that do well when money gets easier. Bitcoin rallies strongest after central banks signal rate cuts or pauses not during the inflation peak itself.\n\nBut heres the catch - cooling inflation doesnt guarantee smooth sailing.

Short- and mid-term indicators show a bearish bias: price is below the EMA10/20/50, MACD is negative, and ADX indicates a weak trend. Oscillators are near oversold (RSI \\~32, stochastic in oversold with an early bullish cross) while price has breached the lower Bollinger Band — a volatility signal that can persist. Immediate support and resistance are tightly spaced (\\~±1–3.7%), with a heavy resistance cluster at 93.6–98k and deeper historical supports well below 42k. This is a tactical environment; momentum and band signals conflict, so resolution may be reflected in weekly closes around the pivot, R1/R3 and S1/S3.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nBitcoin’s weekly price structure frames tactical decisions for traders and for investors tracking trend direction. The latest weekly snapshot (close 86,820, data to 2025-11-24) shows price sitting just under the weekly pivot, inside a volatile, wide-range market. That proximity suggests near-term levels are particularly relevant, as small weekly moves can shift the immediate bias.\n\nThe current picture (quick facts)\n\n* Last weekly close: $86,820.\n* Weekly pivot: 86,895.6 (price is fractionally below).\n* Short/mid MAs: Price &lt; EMA10 (101,354), EMA20 (105,130), EMA50 (99,668).\n* Long MA: SMA200 at 55,798 — well below current price (long-term structural support).\n* ADX: 11.9 — weak trend strength on the weekly timeframe.\n* Market phase labeled: bearish drift with choppy range behavior.\n\nIn plain terms: the mid-term technical structure is biased down (lower highs &amp; lower lows) while the market lacks strong directional momentum.\n\nWhat the indicators are saying\n\n* MACD: Negative and below its signal line (MACD −2,243; signal 1,867; hist −4,109) — momentum is bearish.\n* RSI (14): 32.3 — close to oversold but not an extreme reversal signal on its own.\n* Stochastic: K 13.8, D 10.5 — in oversold territory with K above D (an early bullish cross that can precede short squeezes or temporary bounces).\n* Bollinger Bands: Price is below the lower band (Upper \\~130.7k, Lower \\~90.1k) — a band breach that signals elevated volatility; breaches can persist during trending moves or violent chop.\n* ATR (weekly): \\~10.25k — points to high weekly volatility range.\n\nTakeaway: Oscillators are showing oversold conditions while trend and momentum remain unfavorable. That creates a mixed signal set — short-term bounce candidates within a broader bearish context.\n\nSupport, resistance and the pivot map\n\nKey immediate levels (distance from last close in parentheses):\n\n* Pivot (range mid): 86,895.6 (+0.09%).\n* Resistance cluster (near-term): R1 87,911 (+1.26%), R2 89,002 (+2.51%), R3 90,018 (+3.69%).\n* Extended resistance cluster (supply zone): 93,625 (+7.84%), 94,500 (+8.85%), 96,250 (+10.86%), 98,000 (+12.88%). Major resistance around 108,500 (+24.98%).\n* Near supports: S1 85,804 (−1.17%), S2 84,789 (−2.34%), S3 83,698 (−3.61%).\n* Deep, historical frequency supports (contextually distant): 42,000 (−51.6%), 29,750 (−65.7%), 26,250 (−69.8%), 19,250 (−77.8%).\n\nInterpretation: Price currently trades inside a tight weekly pivot band (\\~±1–3.7%). Overhead supply becomes significant above \\~93.6k and could stall any meaningful recovery. Immediate downside interest clusters around the S1–S3 band.\n\nVolume and recent market context\n\n* Notable volume spikes: 2024-11-11 (breakout volume surge, +100% vs typical) and 2025-03-03 (elevated selling, +35%). Recent selling waves showed expansion in volume, which supports the bearish mid-term narrative.\n* Range (last \\~3 months on the weekly): low \\~86.8k, high \\~123.5k — a wide range (≈42% width relative to the low), reflecting choppy behavior and elevated whipsaw risk.\n\nReading the risk map: what to watch\n\n* Tactical breakout indicators: Weekly closes above 90,018 (R3) would degrade the immediate downside bias and clear a pivot stack, opening the path toward the 93.6–98k supply zone.\n* Breakdown indicators: Weekly close below 83,698 (S3) would confirm a near-term structural break and increase the chance of deeper retests inside the broader range.\n* Narrow triggers: Because the pivot and S1/R1 sit within \\~1–2% of price, small weekly moves matter for near-term positioning.\n\nNote: These are technical trigger observations — not trade recommendations.\n\nConflicting signals and how to interpret them\n\nThere is a multi-horizon conflict: the SMA200 sits far below current price (a long-term structural support), while short- and mid-term EMAs and MACD are bearish. The resolution honors the current structure and multi-horizon evidence: lower highs/lows and weak ADX favor a mid-term bearish view, while the SMA200 provides a longer-term backdrop that would matter only if price moved materially lower.\n\nAlso, oversold oscillators (RSI/Stoch/CCI) and a Bollinger lower-band breach can lead to counter-trend bounces; however, oversold readings can persist in weak trends — so bounces would be described as tactical unless accompanied by structural breaks such as weekly closes above R3 or sustained moving-average crossovers.\n\nBottom line — clear takeaway\n\nBitcoin sits marginally below the weekly pivot at \\~86.9k in a weak, choppy downtrend. Momentum remains negative, but oscillators are oversold and price has breached the lower Bollinger Band — a setup that can produce short-term rebounds inside a larger bearish context. The near-term focus centers on weekly closes around 90,018 (neutralizes the immediate downside stack) and 83,698 (escalates downside risk) for a clearer directional read. Expect volatility to remain elevated given band breaches and widened ATR, with moves that can be swift and noisy.\n\nThis is a technical snapshot intended to clarify structure and levels, not a forecast or financial advice.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1p5hw2j/weekly_bitcoin_oversold_snapshot_testing_the_869k/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Onchain data suggests that some larger investors are offloading positions, locking in losses similar to what we saw during past crash cycles. This is not unusual, historically, sharp declines often trigger capitulation among those who bought near the highs. It’s a reminder that even smart money can get shaken out when sentiment turns fragile, and that price action alone does not always reflect long term fundamentals.\n\nFor retail traders, this environment is tricky. Avoiding losses is not about predicting the exact bottom, its about managing risk in a disciplined way. That means setting stop losses, not over leveraging, and being comfortable with smaller position sizes until volatility cools down. It also means resisting the urge to chase pumps or panic sell during dips. Protecting capital should be your first priority, because opportunities will always come back once the market stabilizes. Many experienced traders emphasize patience, scaling into positions gradually, and keeping cash reserves ready for when conviction is stronger.\n\nInterestingly, some traders are diversifying their approach instead of focusing solely on BTC. With Black Friday events ongoing, a few are experimenting with structured strategies like spot grids and reward based campaigns, where returns can be boosted, some even mention 100% back offers. I have heard these events are live on certain CEXes, including Bitget and others.

Has bitcoin lost a lot of its real world utility with the rising popularity of stablecoins? I'm new to bitcoin and crypto in general, fyi.\n\nMy impression of bitcoin is it has two use cases. The first is as an investment vehicle. Bitcoin has no tangible value, so any appreciation is based on utility and perceived value/scarcity. Utility is tied to its second use case- a way to hold and transfer wealth that is very difficult for the government to monitor and seize. It allows people and organizations to secretly do business and to smuggle/hide wealth from authorities.\n\nWith the advent of stablecoins, either tied to fiat currency or assets like gold, doesn't this have the potential to replace bitcoin's utility with cryptocurrencies that are much more stable in value? If so, that leaves bitcoin in a tulip scenario, where speculation by investors is the only thing holding up its value. Like I said, I'm new to crypto. I'd love to hear if/why I'm wrong from people who are actually educated in the sector.", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1p3jhjf/probably_a_stupid_question_but/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

He said he originally bought those coins years ago when BTC was around 6000 and sold near 90k so he locked in a pretty massive gain. He did not clearly say this was his entire BTC stack, just that he sold this amount.\n\nWhats interesting is hes not selling because he thinks Bitcoins done. He says hes reinvesting the proceeds into two surgery centers and a billboard business that he estimates will generate about 27500 dollars in tax free monthly income by February 2026.\n\nHe also said hes still very bullish and optimistic on Bitcoin and plans to start buying again using the cash flow from those businesses. Earlier this month he repeated his view that BTC could hit around 250k by 2026.\n\nThe timing is what caught people off guard tho. This comes right as Bitcoin dumped into the mid 80k range this week and briefly traded in the low 80ks intraday before bouncing back. We are now down a bit over 30 percent from the October all time high around 126k.\n\nThe Fear and Greed Index hit 11 on Friday which is extreme fear territory and one of the lowest readings this year. Some people are genuinely worried we are sliding into a deeper bear phase.\n\nBut some analysts including Bitfinex commentators have framed the ETF outflows and this downturn as short term stress in positioning and macro, not necessarily a full breakdown of long term institutional interest. And veteran trader Peter Brandt still thinks Bitcoin reaches 200k in the next cycle, roughly around Q3 2029.\n\nSo Kiyosakis move seems more tactical than anything. Take profits when theyre there, reinvest in cash flowing assets, then buy back later when you have stable income.
