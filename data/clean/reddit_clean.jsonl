Not affiliated — just sharing the experience because the structure is pretty different from what I usually see.\n\nThe idea is simple:  \nYou hold a small amount of the project’s token to unlock access, and then you can “hire” explorers using BNB. Those explorers generate BNB rewards over time, and the system gives you two main actions:\n\n**• Compound → reinvest rewards to increase the number of explorers**  \n**• Collect → claim the BNB rewards to your wallet**\n\nThe part I found interesting is that the whole thing is powered by transaction fees.  \nThere’s a 2% fee on the project’s token transactions that gets converted into BNB and added to a shared reward pool. Your share of that pool depends on how many explorers you have.\n\nThere are also standard platform fees (4% on deposits and withdrawals), while compounding has no fee — which is why their docs recommend a “7-day compounding strategy” (compound for 7 days, claim on the 8th). It’s basically a gamified system that rewards consistent reinvestment.\n\nThere’s also an on-chain referral layer that gives a small percentage in BNB from deposits and withdrawals of people you refer.\n\nNot saying it’s perfect or better than traditional yield platforms, but the game-like structure + explorer progression makes it feel different from the typical DeFi farm.

On the surface the change looks like more trading hours and fewer forms, but under the hood it reveals important design choices that matter for composability, settlement, and risk management.\n\nHere are the core technical tradeoffs and opportunities I see when you compare traditional brokered markets to an onchain Universal Exchange model (e.g., Bitget) that supports tokenized RWAs.\n\n1. Settlement and finality Traditional markets rely on multi-step clearing and custodial reconciliation, which introduces settlement lag and counterparty exposure. Onchain tokenized stocks can enable near-instant finality for transfers if the token design and custody model support onchain redemption. That reduces intraday counterparty settlement risk, but it also shifts a lot of legal-compliance complexity into token contracts and their real-world redemption processes.\n2. Composability and programmability Once equities exist as onchain tokens, they become composable money legos. You can program automated strategies, wrap positions as derivatives, or integrate tokenized shares into DeFi lending and staking protocols. Architecturally, that requires careful standards for token behavior, permissioning, and access control so financial primitives do not accidentally break regulatory or operational constraints.\n3. Pricing and oracle reliance Accurate, low-latency price feeds are crucial. Onchain markets typically need robust oracle systems with slashing and redundancy to avoid manipulation. The architectural question is whether price discovery remains primarily onchain using native orderbooks, or offchain feeds continue to inform onchain settlement. Both choices affect latency, manipulation surface, and complexity of dispute resolution.\n4. Liquidity and market structure A Universal Exchange model can unify liquidity across spot and derivatives within a single clearing layer, enabling cross-margining and more efficient capital use. However, onchain order books and AMM-style liquidity mechanisms behave differently than centralized matching engines. Designing for tick sizes, order types, and large-block handling requires hybrid approaches or novel liquidity protocols.\n5. Custody, regulatory wrappers, and redemption mechanics Tokenized real-world assets need a credible legal wrapper that ties the token to an underlying claim. The system architecture must include onchain proofs of reserve, clear redemption pathways, and offchain trustee governance. This is where design, law, and operational security intersect; a technically sound token can still fail if its redemption infrastructure is weak.\n6. Risk controls and user experience Margin, liquidations, and credit risk need conservative, transparent rules when applied to RWAs. Onchain automation can enforce risk limits faster, but it also makes system behavior more deterministic and potentially unforgiving. UX improvements such as unified portfolios and cross-product margin are powerful, but they must be paired with clear liquidation mechanics and fail-safes.\n\nI am curious about concrete architectural patterns people have prototyped or audited for these components.

You know how you need MetaMask for anything EVM, then a different wallet like Petra for Aptos, and so on? It's a pain, and using bridges to move assets between them.\n\nSo, [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3763076), called \"HEMVM,\" proposes a really interesting solution. The core idea is creating a single blockchain that can run different virtual machines, specifically EVM and MoveVM, at the same time, and letting them talk to each other seamlessly.\n\nHere's the gist of how it works, from what I gathered:\n\nThe framework creates separate \"sub-spaces\" for each VM. Think of it like running two different operating systems (like Windows and macOS) on one computer, but they are both part of a unified system. They share the same underlying security and consensus layer.\n\nThe cool part is what they call a \"cross-space handler.\" This lets a smart contract on the EVM side directly call a function on a Move contract (and vice-versa) within a single, atomic transaction. No wrapping, no bridges, no waiting. The paper gives an example of using a familiar EVM wallet like MetaMask to directly interact with a Move-based DeFi protocol like PancakeSwap. Imagine swapping tokens on a Move DEX without ever leaving your Ethereum wallet, that’s the kind of thing this could enable.\n\nWhy I think this is interesting: \n\n- For Users: It could solve the headache of managing multiple wallets and chains. You could interact with dApps across different ecosystems using the wallet you already know and trust.\n- For Devs: They wouldn't have to make the hard choice between building for EVM’s massive user base or using the security features of a newer language like Move. They could have the best of both worlds.\n\nThe performance numbers in the paper look promising too. They claim the overhead is minimal (less than 4.4% for regular transactions) and that these cross-VM calls are still really fast, reaching over 300 TPS for complex DeFi stuff and even higher for simple transfers. Plus, since the VMs run in their own lanes, the chain can process transactions for both in parallel, which gives it a big performance boost.\n\nOf course, this is a research paper, not a live product, so it's all theoretical for now. But it’s a fascinating approach to interoperability that feels more integrated than the bridges and multi-chain solutions we have today.\n\nWhat do you all think? Is this a viable path forward, or are there potential security risks or drawbacks to a model like this?

Safety stays the same, but latency drops.\n\nBecause of this, Aptos runs around 100 milliseconds per block on mainnet today.

Been thinking about a nagging problem in DeFi that doesn't get enough attention: the janky state of automation.\n\nIt's 2025, yet if you want to do something as basic as a dollar-cost average (DCA) buy or set a real stop-loss on-chain, you're usually forced to use an external service. You're either paying fees to a keeper network like Chainlink/Gelato or trusting some random bot. It feels like a weirdly centralized and fragile solution for a supposedly decentralized world.\n\nThis leads to the question: why can't the blockchain just handle this itself? Why can't we just tell the protocol, \"execute this for me when X happens\"?\n\nI was digging around and saw that Aptos Labs is trying to tackle this with a feature they call \"Event-Driven Transactions.\" The idea is to bake automation directly into the L1. So you could, in theory, schedule transactions, set triggers based on price, or chain actions together without an external keeper.\n\nThis sounds great on paper, but it immediately made me wonder: If this is such an obvious solution, why aren't more chains doing it?\n\nThere must be reasons why giants like Ethereum and Solana have historically relied on third-party services for this. My guesses are:\n\n→ Bloat + Complexity: Maybe building this into the core protocol is incredibly complex and could slow the chain down or introduce new bugs. State management for millions of pending \"if-then\" transactions sounds like a nightmare. → Security Risks: Does this open up new attack vectors? What if the price oracle it relies on gets manipulated, triggering a cascade of wrongful liquidations? → Economic Model: Is the keeper-as-a-service model (like Chainlink's) just more sustainable? Maybe the fees generated by keepers are essential for their security and it's a model that works.\n\nSo, I'm just throwing this out to the community, especially the devs:\n\nWhat are the real technical trade-offs of building automation directly into an L1 versus using an external network?\n\nAm I missing other projects that are already working on native on-chain automation?

The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**\n\nCrypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.\n\nTraditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.\n\nSome argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.\n\nUsers are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.\n\nHopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.\n\nMaybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 \n\nThere’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems. That would give us the best of both worlds.

While I am continuing to broaden my understanding about crypto and the blockchain, I'm really interested in recommendations for some more specific research. Right now I have a massive funnel of information and I'm basically choking on it all.\n\nWhat really interests me is the potential for crypto and the underlying tech to make private equity and venture capital obsolete, as businesses, creators, and developers are able to use tokens to leverage their community as investors who want to directly support products/people/ideas they believe in and cut out the middle men of VC/PE and wall street (I currently hold stock in some VC/PE firms registered as BDCs because that's as close as I can get to those market opportunities, and also the whole \"accredited investor\" thing is BS, but I digress.) - something in between crowd funding and IPOs that are superior to both.\n\nI had an \"aha\" moment when I was learning about how smart contracts have been used to code royalties into NFTs and stuff, and realized that this technology is vastly superior to the current way that basically the whole stock market operates. In my hopium-fueled future, shareholder agreements are coded on the blockchain and stock is replaced with tokens - and obviously not just stocks, but all sorts of asset classes, IP, etc, that most people don't currently have good access too.\n\nI believe this is referred to as \"tokenization\" - but I'm still learning all the vocabulary - and also there seem to be a lot of different players out there talking about tokenization as part of their use case, but I'm not sure they all mean exactly the same thing or have the same vision for what that looks like.\n\nIf anyone could recommend specific cryptos that are working on this use, I will happily dive into them. I would prefer better known projects as opposed to deep-in-the-weeds altcoins, but if you think the technology is really compelling then I'm happy to look at it and learn even if only for my own edification and better understanding.\n\nThe four that I am currently studying are Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot - not specifically for what I mentioned above, but because they're the ones that are on my current reading list, although they all do seem to have some aspect of tokenization to them (opinions on these welcome).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n  \nP.S.

Let's discuss the concept I am a backend dev working on DeFi projects. Since I started to dive into DeFi deeper, I got an obsessive idea I just have to get out of my system. I’d love to if someone criticises it constructively.\n\nWhy not shape specific decentralised protocol around DeFi?\n\nHere some basic thoughts. DeFi is all about the rules how value should be distributed. There are finite number of tools types serving this purpose. Thus there is no need in classic smart contracts agility. The protocol could have limited but sufficient number of possibilities to launch your own DeFi tool. Users can operate just with high level abstractions, while all essential algorithms are predetermined by node software. It makes the system load predictable. \n\nThis is the place where things become interesting. Since protocol algorithms are predetermined, transactions types should be structurally predetermined as well. However it doesn’t limit us in the number of transactions types. Each type should represent system activity component. For example there should be «place order» txn, «cancel order» txn, «trade» txn, etc. This approach allows to build order book spot markets, derivatives and lending markets right in Layer 1 chain. Which means (1) less intermediaries, (2) less fees, (3) more safety, (4) more usability.\n\nSticking to this idea, we can spread to protocol economic base rethinking. Since we have no need in classic smart contracts system, we have no need in gas concept. So why shouldn’t we squeeze max out of the idea and make «supportive» transactions, such as «place» and «cancel» orders ones, free. In the end one should pay just for beneficial actions, so transactions types like «trade», «open leverage position», «open derivative position» should should incur charges. To prevent pay-2-win behaviour let’s make fees flat, so no one could pay a little bit more to execute one’s order first. Last, to make the system reliable and fast, let’s guarantee valid transaction to be included into upcoming block algorithmically.  \n\nAlright, what do we have so far. Decentralised L1 protocol with flexible, flat fees table across defi segments, which prevents orders front running, excludes additional intermediaries and allows you to build customised defi tools: from L1 order book spot markets to sophisticated derivatives.\n\nBut wait. If there is flat fees table and guarantees that each valid transaction has to be included into new upcoming block, why anyone should care about network maintenance? What’s the motivation to hold full node? How will protocol become truly decentralised? Well, let’s spread transactions fees among node holders evenly. And to make an economic sense out of it, let’s limit the number of node holders participating in fees distribution at a given moment of time. The limit should depend on protocol trade activity: higher activity — higher the number of participants.\n\nAlright, what about speed in terms of consensus? How do we decide who’s block will be included into the chain fast? Let’s make roles system. We could grant the Leader role to one of the node holders and transition it randomly among participating nodes over time. The other nodes become Auditors. To motivate Auditors lets make each node holder provide security deposit. If any Leader’s misbehaviour occurs, the first Auditor reports it earns the Leader’s security deposit and the network accepts Auditor block.\n\nSo, this is the big picture. What do you think?

Captivated by its promise to drastically alter our digital lives, I was particularly moved by its ethos of individual empowerment, which I believe is necessary for a more prosperous society.\n\nOne underexplored yet promising facet of blockchain is its potential to transform corporate structures. This could fundamentally change how we operate, allowing individuals to participate more fully in decision-making and resource allocation. However, current solutions (DAOs) have been disappointing. To address this, I aim to explore how decentralized technologies can help us build more effective and efficient alternatives to our current organizational structures.\n\n# Traditional Structures: The Company\n\nTo innovate on these structures using decentralized tools, we must first understand them from first principles. The company is the modern organizational structure - so lets define it from first principles.\n\nCompanies are a structured collection of individuals united by a common vision, operating under a defined set of principles and processes to execute tasks aimed at achieving that vision, often with the goal of generating more money than it spends.\n\n# Blockchain Innovations: DAOs\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an open, democratic community with operational actions executed on the blockchain. Voting rights and ownership are determined by token holdings, with the nuances of these rights written in code. Examples like Uniswap DAO, The Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Cardano's Project Catalyst illustrate how DAOs operate.\n\n# Where DAOs Went Wrong\n\nDespite their potential, DAOs face significant challenges:\n\n1. **Slow Decision-Making**: The lack of speed hampers their ability to compete with centralized companies.\n2. **Centralization Under the Mask of Decentralization**: In some DAOs, a few token holders control the majority of decisions.\n3. **Laborious and Inaccessible**: DAO interfaces are often not user-friendly, requiring a steep learning curve.\n\n# What DAOs Got Right\n\nDespite these faults, DAOs have made significant strides in:\n\n1. **Decentralization and Reach**: Allowing strangers to collaborate toward a common goal.\n2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Voting and change processes are recorded on an unchangeable ledger.\n\n# Decentralizing Organizations Day-to-Day\n\nImagine buying an NFT that grants you access to specific roles and tasks within an organization. Every task is tied to a smart contract, and once completed, the task manager reviews the work. Upon approval, tokens are distributed to your wallet. This structure can revolutionize how we think about task allocation and completion within organizations.\n\nFor example, a decentralized company could issue NFTs representing different roles, each with associated courses and task bounties. This system incentivizes motivated individuals to complete tasks quickly and efficiently while maintaining decentralization.\n\n# The New Yogurt Times: Decentralized Media Operations\n\nTo experiment with this possibility, I would create a newsletter called The New Yogurt Times (NYT) within Frontier Media. By collaborating with platforms like Working Dead, I would create courses to introduce the company's vision, processes, and specific domain knowledge. NFTs representing different roles (writer, editor, fact-checker) would be minted, each receiving a share of the revenue generated by NYT.\n\nTasks can be managed through platforms like Discord, which support NFT-based permissions, or decentralized storage solutions like Iagon. While some disconnects remain (e.g., integrating NFT permissions with Substack), these can be managed manually for now.\n\n# Revolutionizing Work\n\nDecentralizing day-to-day operations could provide both stability and flexibility, allowing team members to deliver high-quality work while managing their own schedules. This structure can also complement DAOs, which are better suited for long-term, strategic decisions.\n\nMoreover, this system opens the door for AI agents to function within organizations, provided they can access a crypto wallet. By integrating AI into decentralized business processes, we can address the lack of current AI integration in traditional business structures.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis ideation process highlights the potential of decentralized technologies to revolutionize organizational structures. While challenges remain, the possibilities for innovation are immense. I plan to further refine these ideas and potentially write a whitepaper to explore their merits.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this piece.

But when we dig deeper into those TPS numbers, we find some interesting differences between what's claimed and what's real.  \nBlockchain projects like to show off their \"max TPS\" numbers, but it's important to take a closer look to see what's really going on. We're going to break down the difference between TPS numbers that sound impressive and what they actually mean.  \nTo do this, we've used a straightforward approach. We connected to different blockchains, watched transactions closely, and then did some math based on the last 100 blocks. While blockchains have different speeds, we've kept things simple to focus on understanding TPS.  \nLet's check out the TPS claims of Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Bitcoin:  \nSolana claims \"65,000 transactions per second,\" but the real TPS is 299.91. That's a huge 217 times difference.  \nArbitrum talks about \"40,000 transactions per second,\" but the actual TPS is only 8.07. That's a whopping 4956 times difference.  \nAvalanche says \"4,500 transactions per second,\" but the real TPS is just 2.01. That's a significant 2500 times difference.  \nEthereum's max TPS is 56, but the current TPS is 11.14.

While privacy is considered an essential aspect of tradfi , it is often misunderstood and misrepresented in decentralized systems. As the cryptocurrency industry grows, we must define financial privacy in crypto and develop innovative solutions to manage it. It is crucial to emphasize that privacy in crypto is a fundamental requirement to mainstream user and business buy-in rather than a mere nice to have feature. We cannot expect tradfi volumes in DeFi if we don’t offer tradfi level privacy. For example, fund activity will be limited as long as their DeFi alpha is leaked with every transaction they make on-chain.Contrary to popular belief, crypto transactions are not anonymous.. As regulators increase their oversight and blockchain network analysis tools become more sophisticated, the lack of privacy in crypto has become more detrimental. \n\nIn blockchain development, developers have to prioritize between security, decentralization, and scalability, and privacy is not typically one of the primary considerations. Programmable privacy is an emerging sector of research and development that is being implemented in public blockchains to ensure more secure, scalable, and private-yet-compliant transactional volume. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) technology is one such example. A ZKP is a method by which one party can prove to another party that something is true without revealing any additional information. This technology is crucial for supporting use cases that require information to prove statements of truth, without revealing information that isn't relevant. ZKPs are great for privacy because you can assert that you are entitled to send a transaction (i.e., own the assets on-chain) without revealing who you are, what those assets are, or what your transaction history is. ZKPs can be built into EVM chains and provide account level privacy whilst still maintaining protocol level transparency.\n\nIn conclusion, financial privacy is a right that must be protected, and there are tools being researched and developed to ensure this right also applies to crypto. The industry needs to prioritize privacy before it's too late. Education and engagement at the regulatory level are also essential to showcase the benefits of emerging privacy technologies like ZKP.", "lang": null, "likes": 67, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/123j1z1/crypto_privacy_solutions/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Original article: [https://thecryptoanalyst.medium.com/my-top-pick-for-2023-is-alephium-alph-because-it-sets-a-whole-new-security-standard-for-defi-and-8ebe0cb8a64a](https://thecryptoanalyst.medium.com/my-top-pick-for-2023-is-alephium-alph-because-it-sets-a-whole-new-security-standard-for-defi-and-8ebe0cb8a64a)\n\nThe stateful UTXO model will probably constitute a paradigm shift in Defi because it inherently has much higher security for users and devs. The only known iteration of the stateful UTXO model is in Alephium, which also the project that came up with it.  If we consider each *private key* as an owner, then in the Ethereum network each owner has to keep all their eggs in one basket (the account). One of the advantages of keeping everything in one basket is that it improves the programmability of the network. In Bitcoin the eggs of each owner (private key) can be considered as if scattered all over the place. As result the programmability of the UTXO is much lower compared to the account model and the account model with its all eggs in one basket architecture, despite its lower privacy, is key to Ethereum’s smart contract expressiveness. \n\nIn the account model, secondary tokens issued on top of the L1, such as erc20 tokens in Ethereum, are also kept in the same address. So if we start considering also the tokens issued on top of Ethereum, to visualize everything an account contains we can think of a basket with colored eggs, where each color is a different erc20 token. The advantage in terms of programmability here consists in the fact that if we have a smart contract SC that needs to transfer 2 red eggs from A to B once a condition is met, then the smart contract simply moves 2 red eggs from A’s basket into B’s basket.\n\nIt is here that we can also start to visualize the source of the inherent security risks Ethereum’s dapps and defi. Bugs, hacks, exploits etc often inflict losses because everything (for each user) is contained in one basket. So one may authorise a smart contract to move 2 red eggs, but because of a bug the smart contract may take 4 red eggs instead of 2. Or it may take a yellow egg instead of a red one. Or it may be manipulated to move all eggs of all colours and empty the basket completely. This is the inherent risk that Alephium’s stateful UTXO model eliminates. stUTXO is defined as a hybrid of the account and UTXO model, but the easiest way to visualise it is as a way for an owner to create multiple baskets with the same private key. And just like in the UTXO mode, from the outside these new baskets are completely disconnected and impossible to associate with each other.\n\nIn Alephium, while you can keep all eggs in one basket, you can also create a new basket where for example you put the 3 green eggs that are supposed to interact with a specific smart contract. As result of this, since the smart contract doesn’t get to touch or know where the other eggs are, there is no way for you to lose by mistake, through a smart contract bug or hack other eggs you own in the network. The smart contract interacts only with the basket with 3 green eggs, doesn’t see or get close to any pink/blue/yellow eggs you (may) own. This is from my understanding the superior inherent security and better UX that Alephium’s stateful UTXO model brings.", "lang": null, "likes": 20, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/101ar31/stateful_utxo_explained_a_new_accounting_model/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

The struggle to excel in all three areas at the same time is known as the \"blockchain trilemma.\" Nowadays, many well-known blockchains (like Ethereum) are unable to scale properly, which means network fees are high and transaction confirmation time is long. To answer its own scaling problems, the Cardano network aims to implement Hydra.  \n\n&gt;*Hydra: A family of protocols that overlay the layer 1 Cardano blockchain to process transactions off the main chain. Hydra uses the main ledger as the secure settlement layer, boosts throughput, minimizes the delay in starting to process transactions, incurs low to no costs, and greatly reduces storage requirements.*\n\nBefore we get into Hydra, let’s take a look at some other popular methods for scaling blockchains:\n\n* **Layer-2**: A Layer-1 (L1) is the underlying blockchain and serves as the foundation for a Layer-2 (L2). There can only be one L1, but there can be multiple L2s (for example, Ethereum is the L1 while Optimism, Arbitrum, and Loopring are all L2s for Ethereum). L2s exist on top of L1s and help reduce scaling limitations and transaction costs by splitting the transaction confirmation process in two: L2 for executing transactions and code while L1 handles security, data, and the public ledger. L2s come in several different flavors, like **Optimistic Rollups** (which assume bundles of transactions are valid on default and if any discrepancies are found a fraud proof is initiated to fully verify the transaction), **ZK Rollups** (which operate similarly to Optimistic Rollups, but have validity proofs for every bundle of transactions which are sent to the L1 instead of processing each individual transaction), and **VALIDIUM (**which are essentially ZK Rollups but transaction data is stored off chain and only submit validity proofs and state commitments to the L1). \n* **Sidechains:** Instead of relying on the security provided by the parent chain (like an L1 provides for an L2), a sidechain creates its own independent ecosystem that is connected to the parent chain through a two-way bridge. This means that the parent chain can “decongest” when some transactions are moved to the sidechain. \n* **Sharding:** In contrast to the first two solutions, sharding distributes the load of managing the large amount of data required by rollups across the entire network. This will drastically reduce the cost of storing data on L1. \n\n**Hydra**\n\nHydra is similar to an L2 since Hydra takes transactions off the main chain while using the main chain for final settlements. The off-chain location where participants take their transactions is known as a Hydra head, and transactions in the head will Currently, one Hydra head will include a relatively small number of participants.\n\nThe amount of funds that are designated to a Hydra head during the initial construction of a head are exactly equal to the funds that return to the main chain after closing the head. No funds can be created or destroyed off-chain. Before closing the head, the final state of the head is recorded, including how much funds each participant has after all transactions in the head. The funds that were locked on the main chain during initial construction are then returned to participants in accordance with the distribution outlined in the final head state snapshot. In other words, multiple transactions may occur in the head, but the main chain may skip from the initial snapshot to the final snapshot of the distribution of the funds, reducing the number of transactions on-chain. \n\nAs for the consensus algorithm in the Hydra heads themselves, a simple solution is used: *every* participant has to agree on *all* transactions. As a result, a participant cannot lose his or her funds without providing consent. This consensus algorithm, while simple, prevents heads from having too many participants or participants who are offline for extended periods of time. So initial implementations of Hydra heads will largely be limited to entities with high performance that are online for extended periods (like stake pools).\n\n&gt;*If you enjoyed reading this, consider following/clapping.

However, when Ethereum moved to PoS it lost its decentralization, but we can see other successful networks that run on PoS and keep being decentralized.\n\nMoreover, in terms of usage, to ensure the network is secure, fast and cheap we also need to look at the project's utility, supply and demand.

Multichain can also transfer NFTs just as it can transfer tokens. To carry out these transfers, Multichain uses a network of nodes.

With the latest events regarding hacks and exploits, especially the recent news of 3AC doxxing their customers, privacy rights have to be ensured if cryptocurrencies in general stand any chance for scalability and mainstream adoption.  At this point, it should be absolutely easy for anyone to keep a private balance and maintain an anonymous profile while interacting with smart contracts. This is one of the reasons why Railgun is highly appreciated within the PriFi space for going a step further by making it possible for anyone to seamlessly use its privacy solution since the platform itself is not token-gated. Its low barrier for usage is characterized by users being able to transact stablecoins and perform Defi privately, even on mobile. It is not a privacy coin, unlike Monero and ZCash. Therefore, you can maintain your privacy without being subjected to price volatility. \n\nSimilar to every other invention in the technological era, privacy in cryptocurrency might have some drawbacks. But in the end, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks and might as well be among the most important features that are required for cryptocurrency to go mainstream.\n\nHow important do you think privacy is to Defi and crypto users in general?", "lang": null, "likes": 20, "replies": 46, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/y8r9vf/how_important_is_privacy_to_crypto_users/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Privacy has become one of the most exciting areas of cryptography research alongside projects building focused on privacy.  We’re also witnessing the development of regulatory frameworks that are focused on privacy, such as the American Data Privacy and Protection Act and the EU parliamentary recommendations, which may affect the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. \n\nVitalik Buterin, Founder of Ethereum, made a comment that privacy will become one of the major focus areas in 2023 - this means there’s a big chance that smart contract privacy will continue to expand. The main technology used in privacy is called zero-knowledge proofs, which is quite advanced and arguably better to understand than mixers (which TC uses to obfuscate transaction details). zk-snarks allows for privacy by mathematically preventing information from being revealed while still allowing the protocol to guarantee that transactions execute correctly.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are divided into Zk-stark and zk-snarks, which require a non-zero amount of computation; if they are to be implemented on a larger scale, computation could be a limiting factor. There are other privacy-preserving projects, such as Aztec Protocol which make use of zk-rollups. Additionally, Starkware Industries is using STARK technology to improve scalability and privacy on Ethereum, while Secret Network is building secret contracts that will enable computation over encrypted data.  \n\nRailgun is another on-chain privacy protocol built on the Ethereum mainnet that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-snarks) to obfuscate transaction details and offer users privacy without the need for bridges or mixers. This shines a major light on how robust its security is, considering how bridges have been a major concern due to their susceptibility to hacks and exploitations. However, Railgun offers privacy on a layer 1 level without the need for bridges, making it more secure.  \nThere’s been a lot of talk about Railgun due to its privacy technology and timely development, which has been quite impressive relative to the window period it takes other solutions to attain a peak in their development. It happened to be among the few PriFi solutions to launch a private wallet (Railway wallet), the world's first EVM-compatible zk-snark prover that runs on web, desktop, and mobile platforms. This is a huge advancement in privacy tech, as it greatly increases access to private DeFi so that privacy can be easily accessed from anywhere. Now, the prospective release of the Railgun SDK will also offer more privacy solutions when integrated on other crypto dApps or platforms.  \nThis all goes without saying that users have become more meticulous about their finances; privacy is gradually becoming a major focus in cryptocurrency. Despite the controversy around regulations, as well as privacy and the need for it in DeFi, there is a need to balance privacy, protection, and transparency. The latter has been proven to be possible through the view-only wallet that is characterized by Railgun’s unique key viewing feature, where a key can be generated to share private transactions with another party. This allows a user to cryptographically prove his transaction history for auditing or other purposes if the legitimacy of the users’ funds and activity is questioned. Other privacy preserving systems are likely working on this, but I don’t think I’m aware of any other project that has this feature enabled. \n\nWithout a doubt, privacy preserving protocols will continue to present many interesting theoretical and practical opportunities in cryptocurrency. This is exciting to look forward to, considering the propositions that have been made about mainstream adoption over the next couple of years.", "lang": null, "likes": 146, "replies": 45, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/y756r2/privacy_and_anonymity_enabled_in_crypto_through/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Anyone may lend or borrow.  \n\n\nIn comparison to CeFi, DeFi borrowing and lending provides advancements in efficiency, access, and transparency. Unlike traditional banks and the CeFi platforms listed above, which require users to provide personal information, proof of identity, and go through KYC (know your customer) procedures, DeFi enables anybody to become a borrower and a lender.\n\n**Lets breakdown what is in for us when we borrow or lend from DeFi:**\n\nUsers who wish to serve as lenders can deposit their coins into smart contracts built using the DeFi protocol. They will receive freshly created tokens that are specific to the protocol in exchange. These redeemable tokens serve as a representation of the principal and interest. The annual percentage yield (APY), or interest rate, which is defined by the ratio between provided and borrowed tokens in a specific market, includes the rate of exchange between native tokens and tokens deposited.\n\nThose who wish to borrow money may select one of these processes and provide collateral. The fact that these loans are over-collateralized is a key component. In other words, borrowers put up as collateral a larger sum of cryptocurrency than they borrow.\n\n**So fast forward DYOR, I came across a DeFi which has an efficient working methodology.**\n\n**Aquarius Loan:**  \nWhat Aquarius Loan does is it provides a variety of DeFi solutions in a reliable, secure, and reasonably priced way, Aquarius seeks to contribute to the development and maturation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) area.  \n\n\nDeFi services may be found in abundance on Aquarius Loan. Aquarius is a decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), as well as a decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing protocol that runs on the widely-known BitTorrent Chain (BTTC). Users may exchange, lend, and borrow a variety of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins using the power of smart contracts, all while benefiting from quick transaction speeds, top-notch security, and affordable transaction fees  \n.\n\nUsers will be able to create appealing APYs on their assets as liquidity providers (LPs). They will be able to borrow different crypto assets as borrowers as long as they offer the required collateral. Additionally, $ARS token owners will have the opportunity to take part in decentralized decision-making processes and influence the direction of the Aquarius Loan protocol as stakeholders.

This time we have some more. Hopefully, it doesn’t get too complicated. If it does ask for clarification in the comment section.\n\n**CIP-31**\n\nCardano Improvement Proposal 31 (CIP-31) allows for a new type of input to transactions: reference inputs. These reference scripts will hold information on the output of a transaction without spending that transaction.\n\nCurrently, if a Cardano dApp developer wants to access the outputs of a transaction (to which address does the ADA go and how much is sent and left over), the UTXO must be spent and then recreated. This wastes time (since dApps will have to wait for the next block to recreate the UTXO) and incurs more transaction fees. CIP-31 will greatly improve the efficiency of dApps by allowing them to access more information without paying an extra fee. Ultimately, VASIL will allow transactions with reference inputs to be put on the blockchain for one transaction fee and then that information will be available to all for no extra cost.\n\n**CIP-33**\n\nCIP-33 allows outputs of a transaction to have another editable field: reference scripts. Previously, if a smart contract wanted to use a script in a transaction, it would need to contain the entire script. This makes the size of transaction data larger and incurs greater gas fees for users and dApp developers. With CIP-33, a transactions reference script field will contain a short address that points to the location of the script on the blockchain. So, multiple transactions can use the same script by just referencing it instead having to rewrite the script in every transaction, so any common scripts can become reusable across the blockchain.\n\n**CIP-40**\n\nThis improvement proposal is pretty simple. CIP-40 is meant to protect dApp developers from losing extra funds if they make a mistake while building applications. Transactions using smart contracts require some collateral of ADA to cover the costs of contracts failing, but developers can put more than the minimum amount. CIP-40 gives the extra ADA back if a contract fails and the developer had put more than the minimum amount of collateral. This prevents developers from experiencing unnecessary losses of ADA.\n\nAs you can probably tell, the VASIL hard fork brings many intuitive changes to the Cardano blockchain — improving its speed and usability without compromising on security. Even though the Cardano blockchain is already much more efficient compared to others (like Ethereum and Bitcoin), the future entails many more Cardano users, which can overload the blockchain. To counter this, Cardano needs more hard forks like VASIL (which are planned to occur in the [Basho](https://adacrunch.medium.com/5-years-of-never-ending-innovation-happy-birthday-cardano-d93ea7f91de3#:~:text=Japan%E2%80%99s%20Edo%20Period-,Basho%20%7C%20Scaling%3A,-From%20Cardano%E2%80%99s%20roadmap) era).", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/xwoply/what_exactly_is_the_vasil_hard_fork_in_simple/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

After cryptocurrencies turned up, the functioning of which is carried out in a decentralized network, Internet users could make transfers to each other without the help of intermediaries. Thanks to this, sharing personal information about yourself is unnecessary to make payments. This feature of cryptocurrencies has become one of the main arguments that their supporters put forward to justify the advantages of this technology over conventional electronic money. This advantage has a serious flaw: the cryptocurrency owner only needs to violate security measures once (for example, to purchase crypto on the exchange by a simple bank transfer) for his identity to be disclosed.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which holds transactions performed inside the system into a completely transparent distributed database. If desired, any user of the system can determine how much cryptocurrency was transferred, when and to which wallets. Thus, the security of users from the point of view of anonymity is imaginary. Fortunately, anonymity adepts have created specialized services — crypto mixers. \n\n### What Is a Crypto Mixer?\n\nA crypto mixer is a service, in the form of an app or website, that mixes a certain amount of your coins with coins of other owners, after which the origin of the coins cannot be tracked. This is a way to “confuse the traces” during transactions so that no one reveals where the digital assets in the wallet came from, who they belong to and where they go. Thus, crypto mixers increase the level of security and anonymity.\n\n### Why Are Crypto Mixers Used?\n\nCryptocurrency is a convenient means of payment. With the help of cryptocurrency, fast execution of P2P transfers is ensured. The payment is unknown to the fiscal authorities, and transactions are not carried out via bank accounting registers. At the same time, information about all transactions is stored in a distributed network without reference to a specific person. Data analysis will allow you to track the chain of transfers and identify the initial or final owner.\n\nIn addition, the cryptocurrency is used for settlements on the black market, including on the Darknet.\n\nHowever, anonymizing the transfer is not always associated with illegal actions. There are reasonable reasons to hide a user’s transaction history:\n\n* Transaction security\n* The unwillingness of a particular user to show the presence of an asset\n\nCrypto mixers are used to:\n\n* Eliminate the possibility for attackers to track transactions of law-abiding owners of digital assets\n* Protect personal information\n* Protect against the theft of assets by fraudsters  \n\n\n### Types of Crypto Mixers\n\nThere are two main types of mixers — centralized and peer-to-peer.   \n\nCentralized mixers are traditional services where the mixing of coins occurs by sending a transaction and receiving the amount back in several transfers from other users selected randomly. If many people use the service, it becomes challenging to link the incoming and outgoing transactions of the same user.\n\nHowever, there are two problems with centralized mixers:\n\n* First, you need to trust the service itself. After all, it has information about user transactions and, if desired, can transfer it to third parties.\n* Secondly, there is still a small chance of falling into the hands of scammers who only disguise themselves as a mixer and simply collect user coins without sending anything in return.\n\nPeer-to-peer mixers are anonymizers that solve both problems of centralized services. Peer-to-peer mixers are platforms where owners of digital assets are grouped to form transactions. None of the participants has information about other users, mixing stages, and proportions. Transactions go through several mixes before they get to wallets. The order and number of coins are determined randomly.\n\n### How Does Crypto Mixer Work?\n\nThe algorithm for working with the mixer is quite simple and may vary slightly from service to service, but in general, everything looks like this:\n\n1. Buy crypto (if you don’t have it yet).\n2. Send coins to a crypto mixer.\n3. Coins are mixed. Here you can choose the degree/time of mixing and/or the amount of commission (all these factors are directly related to the mixing quality).\n4. You receive a letter of guarantee from the crypto mixer, which in case of problems, will help you contact technical support and figure out what’s going on because the mixer does not store or require any data about you.\n5. You get the same coins, but already from among the mixed ones.\n\nThe most crucial thing is to choose a crypto mixer so as not to send your crypto funds to scammers. To begin with, try sending a small amount to check the operation of the service, and if everything goes well, mix a large number of coins.  \n\n\n### The Legality of Using Crypto Mixers\n\nIn May 2022, the United States imposed sanctions against the popular crypto mixer Blender.io, in August — against the Tornado Cash ETH mixer. Earlier in 2020 and 2021, Helix, Coin Ninja, and Bitcoin Fog were hit.\n\nThe reason is that mixers are expected to become an effective tool for criminals. Although technologies for demixing transactions already exist, the use of services is still very common.\n\nAt the same time, mixers in most jurisdictions are not considered explicitly illegal. For example, in the USA, they are classified as money transfer services, and each of them is obliged to:\n\n* Register with FinCEN\n* Develop and implement KYC/AML measures\n* Keep records and comply with the requirements of the regulator\n\nOf course, there is little use from such mixers, where you must pass identity verification. Therefore, at the moment, no known crypto mixer would follow these rules.\n\nSince 2020, the use of mixers has increased significantly, and although the rapid growth has calmed down somewhat in 2022, it remains close to record highs. The increase is due to high volumes from centralized crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, and addresses associated with illegal activities. According to Chainanalysis, illegal addresses account for 23% of all funds.\n\nCrypto mixers are a problematic dilemma for regulators and crypto community members. It is impossible to deny that financial privacy is the right of every person. But the data shows that cybercriminals benefit the most from such services.\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nThe program's advantage is hiding the history of previous transactions to get “clean” coins. However, using crypto mixers does not provide a 100% guarantee anonymity. It is possible to decipher the transaction history of a coin that has passed the mixing procedure. Clustering analysis is used for this. Clustering analysis is a special technique that helps to decipher many well-known services. So, similar algorithms were created by Bitfury and Chainalysis. With the help of clustering analysis, it becomes possible to establish interconnected crypto addresses even via a mixer.\n\nIn addition, among the programs for anonymizing digital assets, some services deceive users. It is possible to identify intruders only by reviews on forums. None of the victims will complain to the police.\n\nThanks a lot for reading!

I researched a bit to understand what blockchain-technology has to offer in this regard (e.g. running decentralized social media platforms). If we take reddit as an example: What are the main  prerequisites to run such a platform?\n\n* Speed: Let's assume users create  10 posts per second on reddit.  Add other actions like up-/downvoting, commenting, etc. and all the necessary calls involved in storing/indexing/querying  data related to those posts, you quickly get a way higher number. We easily can reach thousands of calls per second.\n* Storage and storage cost: Posts not only consist of short text. Graphics/Images, animated GIFs and videos need a lot of space, even if scaled down and compressed efficiently. According to several sources you can find via Google, in 2020 1.4 billion videos where uploaded every month!\n* Decentralization and reliability: To store all this data and make it available anytime, everywhere you need mirrors of the storages. You also need strong decentralization, so no party can remove chunks of data (may they be big or small) on their own.\n\nI make the \"bold statement\", that we currently don't have the blockchain technology to meet the above mentioned prerequisites. I also think, that these are major hurdles, we need to take, to make \"Web3\" happen (if it is not reduced to what it is right now). \n\nIf one asks about speed, a typical answer is Solana or some other CC with high TPS. The issue with that is, that we are talking about finite state applications in case of storing crypto-transactions. And even under this circumstances, Solana is not well decentralized. So the speed- and decentralization-requirements are not met with current blockchains to make \"Web3 social media\" happen.\n\nWhat about storage and storage cost? Looking at Arweave, Filecoin, Storj, etc. the costs are way too high. Want to give an upvote and want that upvote to be stored, so others can see it? Well, pay 0,10 € for it! Want to upload a video with your post and share it with the world? Better start saving up on your pocket money!  \nSo, how to store all of the data created each day, make it available all the time? True decentralization means, that there is nobody, who pays for the storage. And users certainly won't do it. History showed over and over again: If there is an alternative, that looks like it is \"free\" (which facebook, Instagram, etc. are certainly not!), they will use it. Even it they are selling themselfes for it (to be fair: most people didn't realize and understood, what companies like facebook where doing – by now everybody and their mothers should understood it).\n\n**TL;DR &amp; question:**\n\nWhat do you think, guys?

One wallet does not support bitcoin segwit but supports TRON, another one only applies Cosmos Network, and etc. I came across an article by Bob Stewell \"Do Unhosted Wallets Dream of Network Fees?\". He argues that due to the fact that blockchains do not reward crypto-wallets they are not in a hurry to make a multi-currency crypto-wallet, which are needed for comfortable usage.\n\nHere where I came to understanding why all those problems are happening. For example, I realized why there are huge purchase fees and a bad exchange rate in wallets. We often have to refer to p2p, CEXs, and DEXs just because of it. In case someone out of the crypto world needs to explain how to switch from one currency to another, the disaster is happening. Oh, I guess the support is the main issue here! At the beginning of my crypto way, I was waiting for answers for several days, and as a result, I’ve figured everything out by myself.\n\nEvery time a new blockchain project that is not supported by one or another wallet is released you have to install a specific application. \n\nThere are many places where the wallet is imported via a 12-word seed phrase, and a 24-word seed phrase is often found in new ones ... Is it so difficult to make a choice? And then I found out that these seed phrases may be in different languages! Even in Chinese, and not all wallets support it also! As for me, I have been using cryptocurrencies for more than 5 years now and I see that wallets are developing really slow. It got so bad that I'm already thinking of developing a wallet myself. \n\nBob believes that the problem essence is in the monetization model - wallets live off a percentage of the purchase or exchange. Adding all the variety of blockchains for wallets is resource-intensive, and wallet revenues will not grow much from this. For me as a user, the problem is really serious, since the ecosystems of Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Polygon, and others are actively developing, and it is impossible to use them all in one wallet.\n\nFrankly, it is much more natural for a wallet that offers a variety of blockchains to provide a range of payment systems and exchangers. But no one does this, because the more profitable this exchange for the user is, the less the wallet’s profit is, or there is even no profit at all. This is a bad system.\n\nThe problem is in the blockchains themselves: they pay miners, they pay stackers, but they don't pay wallets. It seems to me that blockchains can change this situation and start stimulating wallets, and this will give an impetus to development, and strengthen competition. Wallets will fight each other to become number 1! To make the most convenient and intuitive interface (this is a problem for many wallets). \n\nThe solution is the integration of the mechanism into the blockchain, which will send part of the network transaction fee to the wallet that helped the user to carry out this transaction. Then the functionality and service of wallets will improve significantly.

Repost from r/cc since responses were brutal Repost:\n\nIn any blockchain, take bitcoin for example, the previous block's hash is added to the new block. This makes it so that the order of blocks cannot be changed. In other words, it creates an immutable and chronological sequence of events. A \"proof of history,\" if you will...\n\nAm I missing something, or is this no different from what bitcoin and any other blockchains do with hashes in blocks?\n\nAfter reading deeper into it it seems like the main difference is that instead of having a node find a block and broadcast it to all other nodes who then individually audit the TXs in the new block and individually cross-reference each other, Solana chooses a \"leader\" validator via PoS who finds a block, broadcasts it to all other nodes and then tallies the votes from all the other nodes themselves rather than all nodes cross-referencing each other's votes and determining the majority decision (i.e. broad consensus)\n\nit seems like this \"leader\" model where one party counts votes and determines consensus instead of all nodes reviewing all other nodes' votes and determining majority consensus, is what sets it apart and allows for massive throughput and speed.\n\nPLS correct me if I am off or just way wrong on this. I've been trying to understand exactly what PoH is for hours today and outside of the whitepaper, I can't find any decent material that really breaks it down in an honest and simple way. Everywhere I see it written about it is described as this massive innovation but it seems to be exactly the process of hashing in sha256 and new blocks having the hash from old blocks. In fact, it sounds like it is literally proof of work just rebranded.\n\nAlso, I hate to get all fuddy, but if I am correct then this system obviously sacrifices vast amounts of decentralization for speed/scalability far beyond arguments commonly seen around crypto subs like hardware requirements, token distribution, etc.\n\nSomeone responded with this [writeup](https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/BJywSZY9t), but this is just out of reach of my technical level.

So if it's a 80% platform then this means for every $100 you put up you can only borrow $80. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith using this idea these smart contracts can be copy and modify a little to add a few features for renters. The only person that puts up money is the renter. And the required coin could be a stable coin. So what happens is this.\n\n1. Landlord setups on the contract on some site saying how much it cost to rent the place and down deposit, the type of coin (like which stable coin), length of time, and the contract the person renting will signed.\n2. The renter will sign along with the landlord somehow signing it with their wallets. That away joe blow that isn't apart of the deal isn't messing with things, and it is hard attached to the 2 wallets.\n3. The renter will have to deposit the first month and down deposit down.\n4.

If it doesn't see it then based on the settings the landlord gave the renter might lose their deposit automatically. \n5. At the end of the contract period (like yearly when the landlord redoes the rent) the landlord can update the contract on file, the number, and it starts back at 2.\n6. At the end of everything, if the person meets the terms to get their deposit back then the landlord can release the deposit in to the renter's wallet.\n\nThis does 2 things. The first is the landlord can't do a surprise now your rent is double. But this also makes it where they don't have to exactly worry about the renter not paying.

Opening financial products up to all is a great idea, but as it stands today we are severely limiting the innovation and development that can happen in the space because the tools we have are extremely inadequate.\n \nSolidity (and most of the programming languages used for smart contracts today) are general purpose languages - you can build anything with them. But because they’re so generalized, they don’t do a very good job at the one thing that you need most for DeFi and crypto - managing tokens.\n\nIn Solidity, tokens are created as a list of account balances (uint256’s) inside an ERC20 smart contract (e.g. account 0x...123 has 50 tokens, 0x...456 has 100 tokens, etc). To execute a token transfer, a message is sent to the contract with instructions to update a particular account’s balance. But because Solidity has no native concept of an asset, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) doesn’t know the difference between a uint256 that represents a token, and a uint256 that represents any other variable. \n\nLogic around asset behavior, such as the fact that a token shouldn’t be in two places at once, doesn’t exist - the developer has to implement this kind of logic from scratch, for every single contract. It’s like using a swiss army knife to make sushi - sure it can just about do the job, but the sushi gets hacked to pieces. No wonder we see hacks pretty much every week with Solidity smart contracts.\n\nSo, what is the right tool for the job? Well first, what is the job? Defi is the big use case for crypto. Handling assets, handling value represented by tokens. So, we need a tool designed from the outset to handle tokens. \n\nIn Scrypto, assets are a native feature of the language. To create a token in Scrypto, you just call a native function directly within the language. For example “.new_token_fixed(1000)” creates a token with a fixed supply of 1000. To transfer the token, you can call on native functions such as “.take(1)”, which takes a single token, or “.send(1)” which sends a single token somewhere. These tokens are guaranteed to behave like physical assets (like a physical coin), as they always have to live in only one place, which makes it way more intuitive.\n\nBeing intuitive has two massive upsides. First, it makes it easier, which means the barrier to entry for developers is lower. This will get more devs programming more dapps with less limits on innovation. The second upside is it makes dapps more secure. If you can easily see how assets will behave, you can easily pick out when they're going to misbehave. That makes programming and auditing far easier.\n\nScrypto is still in development, but the \"alpha\" release, Alexandria, has just come out . This allows it to be run on a private, local (ie offline), instance of the Radix network. Dapps can be developed and tested here, before going live on the real network next year. \n\nThis early release is both to familiarise developers with the new language and mindset, and also for the team to get feedback on any shortcomings that might exist, and how they can be addressed. I'll post a link below if you're interested in diving deeply into this. If you're a developer just starting out, then maybe giving the documentation a look could really help you make your ideas a reality.", "lang": null, "likes": 88, "replies": 273, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/rh1m82/shifting_the_paradigm_for_dapp_development/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Users are still able to create as many swap pairs as they like among each of the assets, however. \n\nAnd as the exchange is built atop the Sienna Network, which itself is powered by the Cosmos-based Secret Network, many of the interoperability questions will be answered once Cosmos finalizes its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) upgrade.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "pnzv9o", "author": "SenatusSPQR", "handle": "SenatusSPQR", "created_utc": 1631614107.0, "text": "The risks of staking for the long-term crypto environment (originally posted as a Medium article and on r/cc, hoping for some better discussion here)\n\nStaking is one of the more recent buzzwords in crypto. It allows you to earn “passive income”. Different chains offer different implementations of staking. Some make staking very easy, some have high returns on staking, and in all cases you supposedly help secure the network.\n\nIn this post, I explain why if you are invested in a Proof of Stake crypto you might want to dig deeper into your choice as all might not be as rosy as it seems.\n\n# Pointless staking yield\n\nWhat makes most people enthusiastic about staking is that by staking, you earn more tokens as a reward. You make money, without doing anything! These tokens have to come from somewhere. In most projects, staking rewards come primarily from supply inflation. You might receive a 6% yield on your tokens, which seems fantastic until you realise that the supply is also expanding at 6% per year. In other words — in this case you’re not actually gaining anything.\n\nWhen you hold 100 tokens out of a total of 1000 and get 6 extra tokens at the end of a year, you’re not gaining when the total supply has increased to 1060. In both cases, you hold 10% of the supply. This is what I would call pointless staking in its most extreme form.\n\nNot all staking cryptos pay for the yield purely by increasing the supply. This brings us to the next aspect of staking.\n#Redistribution through staking\n\nWhen staking isn’t as simple as everyone gaining an equal percentage, there inherently has to be some redistribution. It might be that you gain 7%, while supply only increases by 6%. This is only possible if not everyone gains 7%. How is this possible? There are two options, broadly speaking:\n\n1. Yield consists of a combination of inflation and fees paid or;\n1. Yield is paid from block rewards increasing supply, but supply is at the same time decreased through burning transaction fees.\n\nThe first option is the most basic and oldest form of staking, and is most comparable to Proof of Work. In Proof of Work, you gain a block subsidy for mining a block, and you get the fees paid for the transactions in the block. The same holds true in staking. Stakers are paid (a percentage of) the block reward and fees paid for transactions. The 7% staking reward you get might therefore come from increased supply (6%) and from fees paid (1%).\n\nThe second option is an option that tries to hide the centralization over time by not having fees accrue to stakers but rather having them burnt. This means that the fees are sent to a burn account, that cannot be accessed. As an example, stakers might get a 7% staking reward, which consists of 5% block rewards, and a 2% decrease in supply due to fees being burnt. While good for you as a staker, there is an obvious downside to both options.\n# Discouragement of using the crypto\n\nIf you pay fees to use the chain, while getting staking rewards for not using the chain, there is a clear disconnect. Those using the chain will hold less and less of the supply, while those staking hold an ever larger share of the supply. While you as a staker would be happy with the yield you are getting, users would clearly be happier if they could pay lower fees, and might look to cheaper and more efficient solutions.\n\nPerhaps those staking also have an interest in using the network sporadically. In this case, staking still leads to centralization over time. Fees are denoted in absolute terms (say 0.1 XYZ), rather than relative to your holdings. If small and big holders both transact, the small holder is paying a far larger percentage of his holdings in fees than the large holder is.\n\nIn a scenario where small holders hold 1 XYZ, large holders hold 1000 XYZ, and transaction fees are 0.1 XYZ, a single transaction costs a painful 10% of the holdings of the small holder, while the large holder would barely feel the 0.0001% fee.\nDouble discouragement through lock-up periods\n\nIt potentially gets even worse. Many staking cryptocurrencies force you to lock up your crypto to receive staking rewards. This is the model ETH2 is using as well. When you lock up your tokens, you can’t use them until after the lock-up period. As a small holder, you might be okay locking up some of your tokens (longer-term savings), but you also need some tokens for usage.\n\nA large holder might also want to use some of their tokens occasionally, but can lock up a far larger percentage. We see this in traditional finance — the richer you are, the larger the percentage of your net worth that is invested rather than in cash.\n\nBecause of this, while you might get just 5% on your total holdings as you keep some funds available to use, large holders might be getting 6.9% as they are able to lock up almost all their tokens.\nFurther centralization through staking pools\n\nTaking ETH2 as an example again, setting up a staking pool is not cheap. ETH requires 32 ETH staked (~$100k) to participate in validation. If you don’t have 32 ETH, which many of us do not, you have to join a pool to stake. Pools charge fees for this, either a fixed fee per month or a percentage (10–25%). This fee once again accrues to larger holders.\n\nIn other chains such as Cardano setting up a stake pool is far cheaper. Regardless, the same holds true. There are costs to set up a stake pool, and there are fees associated with joining a stake pool. Those with large holdings become ever larger, while small holders hold relatively less and less.\n#Summarizing the futility of staking\n\nProof of Stake has two possible results. Either everyone stakes, no redistribution happens, and nothing is gained for anyone through staking. The other option is that not everyone is rewarded equally for staking, causing redistribution. This redistribution inevitably accrues to the largest holders, causing centralization of consensus power and supply over time.\n\nBecause of this, I believe that Proof of Stake makes small holders relatively poorer, rather than richer. At the same time, staking decreases decentralization &amp; security, therefore decreasing the value of the protocol as a whole.\n\nFor those interested, I’ve written about methods to avoid [centralization over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize). I’ve also [written about Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an), a cryptocurrency that has 0% inflation, 0 fees, and that remains decentralized and secure over time.\n\nThanks for reading.

Not with ETH but with basically any other POS SC \n\n\nBut I was thinking what if there were some way to monetize those coins which are serving as POS to offset some of the inflation? \n\nCould it count as proof of stake if a validator wasnt holding, say, SOL but was instead holding a yield earning token that represented SOL plus a yield from a SOL yearn-like vault? You can remove tokens at any time from a vault so you can always get the SOL back. (Technically youd get wSOL out of a vault but you can always change wSOL to SOL anyway.) Then the coins would be earning a yield that could be used to offset inflation of POS. And a ytoken IS arguably an IOU of that underlying token... could it serve as POS?\n\nAdmittedly this means the network security is now exposed to risks inherent in other dapps and maybe that is unacceptable. But the inflation on Solana right now compared to the fees generated is totally unsustainable.\n\nAlternately maybe the coins stay in the validator but them as collateral to borrow stablecoins to deposit on Yearn or something. Of course that also has limitation...what happens if the coins start crashing in value and the coins are at risk of liquidation? How do you even borrow against coins locked in POS?

It introduces a bottom-up approach to building new financial infrastructure, allowing users to police network activity and help dictate the direction of each project. Unlike the financial and capital formation systems that govern us today, users themselves wield the power.\n\nPublic blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate according to these standards. Bitcoin was created in part to provide a check on central bankers that are prone to mismanaging money supplies and abusing their immense power. Ethereum unlocked the ability to create globally accessible programmable applications that can be governed by a community of token holders and open-source contributors. These models created the conditions for realizing the first part of Naval’s thesis for crypto: maximum decentralization.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin and Ethereum excel at distributing power to the many, their current public-by-default designs will likely not provide a full solution for Naval’s second outcome - maximum privacy - now or anytime soon.\n\nThis lack of user privacy stands out starkly in the modern age of surveillance capitalism and state-level surveillance. The transparency of Bitcoin and Ethereum may only feed into these existing concerns. They enable end-to-end surveillance on every financial transaction for each wallet, and supplementary solutions like mixers face liquidity and usability challenges that may limit the level of privacy they can offer.\n\nPrivacy coins like Monero and Zcash sprung up to address these issues. They use complex cryptography to obfuscate transaction details, thereby preserving user privacy and increasing security. But they fall short in meeting the demands of DeFi users since neither supports smart contracts at this time, creating a gap in the market.\n\nSecret Network aims to fill this void. It’s one of the first blockchains to support programmable smart contracts with privacy by default, which launched on the Secret mainnet in September 2020. Secret will face its fair share of hurdles trying to build up a user base, like overcoming users’ general apprehension towards sacrificing convenience over privacy. However, private smart contracts also introduce significant usability advantages and unlock important new use cases. As privacy graduates from a nice-to-have to a necessary feature for users of complex Web3 applications, Secret Network could be one of the sector leaders for private computation.\n\nHere's the link to the full article: [https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network](https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network)", "lang": null, "likes": 9, "replies": 30, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/pkzsyu/new_messari_research_report_on_secret_network/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

The ETH 2.0 people have some magic fairy dust idea, the Cosmos people are grounded in reality that sharding+POS doesn't work, so they got for a Hub-Spoke model (layer-1 single chain, layer 2 spokes), and every other project falls somewhere in between. I have zero idea how POS's security doesn't degrade as a POS attempts to scale up. POS already has massive security problems that sharding exacerbates dramatically  \n\nHowever, ETH is going to be around forever, much like BTC. It's the scaling and the limits of solidity that will hold it back from real \"change\". That doesn't mean it can't be a great showroom for the early phase of defi. Moreover, solidity is just a monster to develop in so when we're talking big money dapps they can't advance too much too fast, it's just not safe.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;LAYER 2 (matic arbitrum etc) \n \nOverall, all layer two solutions have their place but aren't the solution, just a solution that make sense for specific ecosystems and contexts, and not as a general solution to scaling.  \nI doubt if Eth demanded a sidechain for dapps we'd have seen the explosion in innovation that we've seen over teh past 5 years. Moreover, if you use Layer2 solutions, at some point they need to settle through the base layer1 to move funds/etc around to a different layer2 app... you can't really go Layer2-&gt;Layer2 direction, mainnet settlement is needed (layer2-&gt;layer1-&gt;layer2). If Layer1 isn't scalable, then at some point, assuming adoption takes place, layer1 will get congested enough that fees on txs go through the roof.  \n\n\nTHE biggest unsolved problem in crypto for the last decade has been has been: how do we scale layer-1? Specifically, how do you shard/partition layer-1 ledger state. It has been a unsolved problem for so long, and so many BS \"solutions\" have been pitched, that most people have given up on decentralized layer-1 scaling being a solvable problem (and have turned to centralized and/or layer-2 solutions instead.   \n\n---\n\n&gt;POLYGON \n \n5 keys locking 10billion TVL that's INSANE, it's not decentralization that's a rugpull waiting to happen, we're in crypto to eliminate trust, and now we trust billions to 5 people, it's asinine that's what it is.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;ALGORAND  \n\nInteresting tech but terrible tokenomics, almost fully premined and distributed among insiders/team/VCs, smart contract automatically accelerates distribution for \"early backers\", suppressing the price, can't run a node unless you register with the foundation and get approved.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;BSC  \nChain made to be a PnD heaven nothing more, will not exist in a few years  \n\nSupply given to insiders - 50%\n\n\n---\n\n&gt;ZILLIQA  \n\n&gt;TEZOS  \n\nTezos is trying to do things right, good smart contracts... sadly both have an unscalable base layer \n\n---\n\n&gt;FANTOM  \n\n38 Nodes! Nice decentralization guys, do you want to know why they are doing this? it's because all deterministic BFTs performance degrades with consensus node count (this is a fundamental aspect of dbft and thus all \"fast finality\" POS\"). I highly doubt we'll ever see a +200 node POS network with high utilization... POW being probabilistic consensus is a feature that allows for globe spanning trustlessness.\n\nFurthermore, arbitrary DAGs have known performance problems under adoption, they initially have many more execution channels, because transactions are largely unrelated, but as adoption picks up and massive dpps appear on the platform the overall performance decreases because transactions become increasingly related  \n\n---\n\n&gt;AVAX  \n\nAvax mainnet is unsharded. Which means it cannot scale, and again with the DAG.\n\nTheir consensus might be nice but is not battle tested. \n\nIt also seems that Avalanche does not even support cross-subnet transactions at all, right now. They have subnets, but they can't communicate with each other and if they cross-subnet transactions, they are very likely not atomic. Atomic transactions are very important, because it is given by default on unsharded networks and ensures that multiple sub transactions can be combined in one transaction and if one fails all fail.\n  \nBesides that, the subnets are permissioned = centralized control  \n\nSupply given to insiders - 42%\n\n\n\n&gt;ELROND \n \nThe main problem of Elrond is that it doesn't allow for atomic transactions across shards. Meaning if you have dapps which interact with each other (like most DeFi dapps like Uniswap or Aave) you need to deploy them in one shard but this leads to having no scalability (because all interacting dapps are limited by the throughput of one shard), so It's basically useless for anything in defi, it's like going a step backwards from ethereum. \n\n---\n\n&gt;HARMONY  \n\nIt's better described as a layer-1.5 scaling solution if we're being generous. Their problem that the other shards are shoving work onto shard 0 currently (making it slow down because it's processing the bulk of work) is something that isn't possible with a properly scaled layer-1 solution... or at the very least there's a whole new host of economic problems now that shards can fight over doing the least work.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;POLKADOT  \n\nThe problem with Polkadot is that they are more or less a collection of independent blockchains. And transactions between parachains are not atomic. This makes them basically a bunch of isolated islands which are unable to scale. \n\nSupply given to insiders - 35%\n \n&gt;COSMOS  \n\nuses hub-and-spoke, which has the liquidity problem that comes with all layer-2 solutions (you have to de-stake from one peer/spoke, settle to hub, then re-stake to new spoke, to transmit funds... and the hub is low bandwidth so that de-stake is expensive).  \nall in all it's pretty alright despite it, but another problem is that atom is token not needed the coin, maybe it will change with the dex though  \n\nSupply given to insiders - 22%\n\n---\n\n&gt;NEAR  \n\n22 Nodes, Pretty Centralized if you ask me  \n\n---\n\n&gt;IOTA\n\n&gt;ADA\n\nVaporware, I don't care what anyone says, if anything launches then I'll reconsider. (yes radix has it's own little chain with 50tps and no smart contracts, it's not a real project until it releases anything stop spamming)\n\n---\n\n&gt;RADIX\n\nAlso Vaporware, 50tps meme chain with no smart contracts after 7 years of RnD. \n\n---\n\n&gt;SOLANA  \n\nSacrifices decentralization, also the multiplexing of executions take place post consensus, which is effectively Hashgraph. These approaches have the fundamental issue in that, Ahmdal's Law + small world problem basically limit the overall parallelized network throughput to 6x sequential (10x max).  +\n\nSupply given to insiders - 48%\n\n&gt;HBAR  \n\nIt's a corpo coin for institutional use. Its entire setup is for this purpose, the tokenomics, the governance and permissioned nodes are tailored for this purpose of catering to enterprises, or centralized financial use cases.  \nTherefore It will never see the demand that eth or it's competitors are seeing right now, why? because their price is going up because of defi, no one is going to build defi on hbar which means.. no price appreciation.  \n\n---\n\n&gt;MINA\n\n&gt;SAITO\n\nSolutions looking for a problem.\n\n---\n\n\n&gt;FLOW\n\n&gt;SKALE\n\nMORE than 50% of the supply was given to insiders, 58% with flow and 67% with skale. I'm not even going to bother looking into the tech at that point, what a joke\n\n---\n\nThis is peak clown market.\n\n---\n\n\nUnrelated to any specific coin, but the weird bit, which I can't really describe succinctly, is how much a POS system looks like a decentralized Ponzi or MLM. This is mostly because the only way to buy/get tokens is to buy them from people that already bought them vs POW where anyone can mine and capture newly issued tokens (and in equities where a company can sell new stock). It's a loose metaphor that I'm not sure I could convince a regulator of, and yet a defining feature of MLM/Ponzi/POS is that inventory can only be purchased from previous owners. \n\n\nalso unrelated to any coin but Staking and POS is very good for large VCs that want to control what supposed to be a decentralized system... honestly POS degrades into feudalism longterm. Moreover, POW is fundamental to sharding that works... Much like Visa, POS is good for a low throughput, near-instant centralized single chain/settlement layer. POW is good for a high throughput, pretty-fast large decentralized network of chains/settlement layer.  \n\n\nAll that said, the ecosystem is in a weird place right now where decentralization is forgotten in the pursuit of profits and things like binance chain and layer 2 solutions are accepted without much consideration. Blockchains being decentralized is core to resiliency, but decentralization is slower. All in all, I'm a bit concerned that crypto is opening itself up to a black swan event. It could be regulators, it could be a crash that dominos into the staking needs of POS, but being a black swan it's hard to say. its possible for a blackswan in Defi to crash into the consensus layer with POS. Kinda like a market crash taking out a bank in addition to collapsing a market. Not so much with POW because it sandboxes any collapse pretty cleanly in the application layer.", "lang": null, "likes": 55, "replies": 55, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/p9cfnr/the_sad_state_of_smart_contract_protocols/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Crypto currency is a way to store value without human compromise, a way to transfer those value without people's  unfairness. Nevertheless part of transferring value is transferring value between generations known as inheritance (Next of kin), as broken as the current financial system is, they do offer this very part of finance.\nThis might not be a huge problem now, but with time this will become an unavoidable huge problem.\n\nAs speculation have it, Satoshi might be dead, never can tell, but if he is, then his value stored on crypto is lost forever which in a short time means good for crypto value, but how long before everyone holding crypto losses those value due to dead and lost of wallet seed?.\nSharing your wallet seed doesn't cut it, as it will grant your Next of Kin access directly to those value while you are still alive, giving a lawyer compromise the security of those value as it only require your lawyer for those value to be compromised.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\na well secure decentralised finance that doesn't have access to your value, cannot give your Next of Kin access to your value while you are still alive but can securely verify your Next of Kin and help them securely gain access when you are gone. \n\nMore details to be disclosed to programmers and investors who are willing to see this turn a realized project.

One of the key tenets of blockchain decentralization is enabling users to run nodes and verify themselves. Indeed, a blockchain network where users are unable to run full nodes are essentially not trustless, because you're trusting validators/miners. A common misconception is that miners/validators run the networks - it's actually the full nodes. Miners/validators simply provide a service. It's alarming that most blockchain networks do not have a culture of users verifying, and they conveniently sweep this critical flaw under the rug while they boast of \"XXX TPS\". To be clear - there's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's just that these blockchains are not decentralized and not trustless, and should not be compared to those that are. \n\nJameson Lopp has completed a fascinating series of tests on various blockchain full nodes:  [2021 Altcoin Node Sync Tests (lopp.net)](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/). \n\nIt's immediately obvious Bitcoin still takes point when it comes to decentralization. The benchmark is set, with Lopp's reference system taking less than 3 hours to sync 12+ years of Bitcoin. Bitcoin-like networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin also do well. Of course, they do well due to the very limited scalability and utility, but that's the trade-off involved. \n\nMoving on to Ethereum, you can immediately see things get far more challenging. Geth no longer runs on a 1 TB SSD, so Lopp couldn't complete a full sync. But from my experience, it takes about a week to sync. Erigon is Ethereum's fastest client, syncing in two and a half days. It makes some smart choices, which may prove controversial to purists, but I think it's just clever optimization. While that's still far more than Bitcoin, given the amount of utility and scalability Ethereum has provided over 6 years, this is absolutely remarkable. Using the hardware fully, Erigon is a highly optimized client, and perhaps the best in the blockchain industry. \n\nStill, it's obvious that Ethereum is on the very ragged edge of how far L1 scalability can be pushed. Some would argue that it's already way over the limits. People love to complain about high gas fees and such, but actually, this is as good as it's going to get for a decentralized network. \n\nMonero takes nearly as long as Erigon, despite significantly less usage compared to Ethereum over the years. It's still definitely on the edge of being called fully decentralized. \n\nUnfortunately, things start to look very dire as we move on to other protocols. Polkadot and Cardano take 5 hours and 10 hours respectively, which is insane given how little activity these chains have had, with both being live for not more than a year. Once they roll out smart contracts and if they have some real utility and usage on chain, they are going to end up being centralized very rapidly. Granted, both have very poorly written clients, so there's room for optimization to make better use of the hardware. \n\nBinance Smart Chain is the perfect cautionary tale. Despite having meaningful activity for only 6 months or so, it already takes 13 days to sync - which is longer than Ethereum despite forking off Geth. Binance like to boast how they have 8 times the throughput of Ethereum - clearly, it comes at a very steep cost. I estimate within the next year or two it'll be practically impossible to sync on a consumer PC. EOS has already reached there, it takes week/months. \n\nIncredibly, it's already impossible to sync Solana from genesis! Your only option is to get snapshots from Solana Labs. For all intents and purposes, Solana is no longer a decentralized network. On Lopp's high-end consumer PC, he was unable to sync even after getting the snapshot! To be fair, Solana does require 128-256 GB RAM, so this was to be expected. Solana has been live in earnest for 6 months or so, and most of their activity is just Serum (which in turn I suspect is mostly bots and market makers). Already, they have a skip rate of 33%, i.e. 33% of their blocks are not produced on time. How are things going to look years from now? \n\nFinally, we have ICP which flat out don't let you run a full node - you have to buy one of their approved supercomputers. \n\nObviously, this doesn't cover all blockchains, but the general concept holds. The trilemma is real, and the more you push scalability, the harder it gets to run a full node, and the more centralized your network becomes. It's clear that Bitcoin and other Bitcoin-like networks such as Litecoin are the only ones that are unarguably decentralized. Ethereum is at the very edge of this, though Erigon does make things better. Everything is simply not decentralized. \n\nSo, what are the solutions? Geth has implemented fast sync, which doesn't verify all transactions, but downloads the blocks and verifies the proof-of-works. Ethereum's consensus (eth2) clients use weak subjectivity sync to start at a recent block and sync backwards. Techniques like this may be controversial to purists, but to others, they achieve the same results without materially sacrificing decentralization. \n\nWhile the article covers full node syncs, there's another important aspect to it: can a full node stay in sync after the initial sync is complete? For example, with Solana, even using centralized snapshots it was impossible to stay in sync with Lopp's PC. I'd say Binance Smart Chain and presumably Polygon PoS are at the edge of what's possible on a relatively high-end PC today. \n\nA long term solution is stateless clients, where full node clients need not hold and sync the full states - just witnesses. It's a high priority on Ethereum's roadmap, and this will finally make it easy for the average user to run a node. Of course, it won't help full nodes and block proposers, who'll still need to hold the full state, but it'll go a long way in making Ethereum as easy to use (and even more so) as Bitcoin. This will be combined with state expiry, where every year or so inactive state will be expired and archived. Together, statelessness and state expiry will dramatically improve the situation around state size management, which as you can see from the rest of this post is very dire. But obviously, this has its limits and will not help with keeping sync. \n\nSo how do we attain blockchain scalability? The answer is through innovative techniques like rollups and sharding. It's pretty clear a monolithic blockchain will always be highly constrained, no matter what marketing departments claim. This is a whole different can of worms, though, so I'll conclude this post here. \n\nTl;dr: Bitcoin is the only unarguably decentralized network in crypto (and Bitcoin-like networks), and Ethereum is arguably the only other one. We have to hold blockchain projects to a higher standard and force them to use innovative techniques to attain scalability rather than brute force that leads to these networks being inherently centralized.", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 20, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/ow82rx/blockchain_full_nodes_decentralization_and/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.\n\nBoth are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.\n\nDefinition\n\nAPR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nAPY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nWho uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.\n\n&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.\n\nWhat Are They Different?APR\n\nFor example, a yield farming program offers an APR  \nof 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  \n.\n\nOnce you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.\n\nFormular\n\nAPR = r x N\n\nWhere:\n\nr: The interest rate of the year;\n\nN: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).\n\nAPY\n\nAPY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.\n\n&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?\n\nIf you have an APR  \nof 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  \nby 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  \n.\n\nAssuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  \nand APY  \nof these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.\n\nFormular\n\nAPY = (1+r)\\^n - 1\n\nIn which:\n\nr: The interest rate of the period;\n\nn: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).\n\nAwareness\n\nAs such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:\n\n* First, displaying APY  \nwill produce a larger percentage than APR  \n, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.\n* Secondly, the APY  \ninterest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).\n\nToday we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.\n\nRead more [here](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/apy-and-apr-83f)", "lang": null, "likes": 271, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/nnathc/differences_between_apy_apr_in_crypto/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I would appreciate if someone could read and let me know if this already exists or has fundamental flaws.\n\nMy idea is based on a smart contract that would have access to and protect private info as well as manage public info. Private info: Combination of identifiers like biometrics (thumb print)/IP address/device identifier (e.g. mac address) associated with a wallet. Public info: wallet address and wallet credit score.\n\nOperation: A user can build credit through submitting the private info to the contract and taking out small loans that are partially/wholly collateralized with a relatively high rate of interest. Upon repayment, the smart contract registers a higher credit score associated with the wallet. If unpaid, the credit score decreases. Below some threshold score, the user can no longer take out loans. The small size of initial loans and combination of identifiers required would make it infeasible for a bot to attack the system by taking out many small loans and not repaying. Perhaps the protocol could start out with some staked/pooled funds to cover initial losses and encourage lending. As a borrower's credit increases, they would be allowed to use less collateral and pay lower interest rates. Ideally this could solve the issue in DeFi of loans needing to be overcollateralized.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

This functionality will be available cross-chain through Chainlink. How do they? Source: [https://blog.ltonetwork.com/understanding\\_did/](https://blog.ltonetwork.com/understanding_did/) (credit to [Mickey Maler](https://blog.ltonetwork.com/author/mickey/))\n\n**What DID is:**\n\nA Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a new type of identifier that is:\n\n* globally unique\n* resolvable with high availability\n* cryptographically verifiable\n* issued for a lifetime (unless revoked by the owner)\n\nDIDs are typically associated with cryptographic material, such as public keys, and service endpoints, for establishing secure communication channels. DIDs are useful for any application that benefits from self-administered, cryptographically verifiable identifiers, such as personal identifiers, organizational identifiers, and identifiers for Internet-of-Things scenarios.  \n\n\nThe same way the [*SSL/TLS protocol*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) changed internet use forever by opening a gate to the world of encrypted Web traffic, which is the basis for the protocol that keeps the web safe and secure HTTPS; the same way will DIDs enhance the verification process in world of blockchain, such as decentralized finance.  \n \n\n**The DID is a new standard of representing users’ identities by referencing subjects in a decentralized way. It is an identifier that references a subject such as:**\n\n* a person\n* an organization\n* an object\n\n**The use cases for DIDs include:**\n\n* Identifying people, organizations, and things\n* Achieving a number of security and privacy-protecting guarantees\n\nDIDs are unique identifiers that specify a resolution method for a DID and a blockchain address that represent its owner. \n\n**Example:**  \n   \nLTO's Lead Architect's DID stored on LTO Network would have DID [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (a pointer) set like is: \n\n***did****:****lto****:****3JuijVbbserasr48h8rz8451RTyeL***\n\nThe format of this is: ***scheme****:* ***the method used****:* ***user's pseudonymous ID***  \n \n\nThe example DID above resolves by DID Controller to a DID document, the minimal example of which you can see below:  \n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n {\n\n***// context explicitly defines the subject - i this case, DID***\n\n\"@context\": \"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\",\n\n\"id\": \"did:lto:3JuijVBB7Nrasr48h8rz8451RTyeL\",\n\n\"authentication\": \\[{\n\n ***// used to authenticate as did***\n\n  \"id\": \"did:lto:3JuijVbbserasr2Ea5hCDz8451RTyeL#keys-1\",\n\n  \"type\": \"Ed25519VerificationKey2020\",\n\n ***// A DID Controller is an entity that has the capability to make changes to a DID document***\n\n  \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",\n\n  \"publicKeyMultibase\": \"zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV\"\n\n}\\]\n\n}  \n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe DID document contains associated cryptographic information (like public keys) that allows the DID controller to prove they are/own the subject. This is possible thanks to the fact that every identifier is signed with a user private key. The public key, uniquely paired with the private key, is then published to a distributed ledger.\n\nWhen a DID is resolved, the extracted public key is compared to the public key stored on a blockchain. A DID document is something like a “blockchain hand-shake” between the information stored in the DID and on a blockchain.  \n\n\nFor a proper functionality of DIDs on the LTO network, any DID must be indexed first. Indexing is a process that connects the public address with the associated public key. An address owner can do so using a simple anchoring transaction that will ensure their DID is properly indexed.\n\nThis is caused by the fact that the blockchain address is generated from the public key using a one-way hashing function, which makes it impossible to extract the public key from an address.\n\nWithout the anchoring transaction, the public key for an address remains unknown.\n\n**Unification with a real-world identity**\n\nCombination of DID with a proof of identity, which was issued by some authority, enhances the DID capabilities. DID can be part of Verifiable credentials (VC), which acts as digital certificates, ID, diplomas, or many others. This way, it is possible to verify the identities of persons or objects, and also, it is possible to add a value to these objects. Using a VC with DIDs that contains information about several real estate properties, can act  as proof of ownership and value for these objects.  \nCombining DID with VC keeps the user credentials private.  \n \n\nCombination of DID with a certificate issued by a Certificate authority (CA) creates a great tool for companies that want to cooperate in trust networks and their identity is claimed by the certificate issued by CA.  \nCombining DID with an CA issued certificate (type x509) keeps the company credentials public, this saving time with manual searching for the company credibility.\n\n**Summarization**\n\nDIDs enable you to reference subjects in a decentralized way. DIDs can be resolved to DID documents. DID documents allow the controller to prove they are/own the subject. LTO Network generates these documents for all LTO accounts, which have done at least one TX. These accounts are created by publishing a certificate which is related to a DID, thus making a connection between the DID and real-world identity. DIDs can be part of Verifiable credentials (VC) .  \n \n\n**Additional suggested reading:**\n\n* [DID for DeFi?

This post shows not only how btc/LN can participate in defi cheaply, but it can also act as a bridge between all chains.\n\nThere are many ETH compatible blockchains that provide the same utility as ETH, though with less security (matters only for large amounts), less decentralization, and questionable long term value due to insider allocations and associated future selling pressure.\n\nAn alternative to a mint/burn bridge is, to use a defi analogy, a single asset liquidity pool on one (destination) chain with a transfer dapp on source chain.  2 simple things can happen on destination chain.  Either LP shares are minted and given to transferrer, or \"cash\"/tokens is taken out of the pool and given to transferrer on the destination chain.  Liquidity fees are accrued to LP share holders,based on the depth of the pool.\n\nThe tokens on the transferrer side can be managed on whichever chain is cheapest.  By managed, I mean the simplest transfer transaction happens to be LP shares that are tracked on one chain, but represent a share of value on the transferring chain.\n\nFor ERC compatible chains the benefit of this may be minimal, but Polygon to ETH is extremely expensive bridge, and these may be simpler contracts.\n\nBut the main point of this post is bridging to LN/bitcoin.  Bitcoin holders may want to access utility of smart contract platform including stablecoins, and as part of swap, create a LN channel with an entity that has interest in both LN/btc and the utility chain.  A LN channel has 3 assets of value for each party.  A btc balance, outgoing capacity, and incoming capacity.\n\nThe scheme requires a federation of utility token holders that are willing to trade outgoing LN capacity creation for utility tokens.  Federation members must maintain a web of LN channels with each other.  Utility token LP holders (single asset \"liquidity pool\") need to independently from their LP investment buy LN outgoing capacity from a federation member up to their highest imaginable proceeds from their utility token trade.  Trade price is set by oracles  LP holders receive fees for providing liquidity to market price.  A LN buyer of utility token will have created outbound liquidity to a Federation member.  His buy order is an LN transaction contingent upon the federation member triggering the Utility chain's dapp and routing the bitcoin purchase to LP holders on their LN channels, The triggered dapp releases the utility tokens from the LP pool to the LN buyer.  These conditional payment chains are already part of LN technology.\n\nThis process attached to multiple chains, easily extends to using LN as a bridge between all chains without needing a 1:1 burn/mint bridge, may be cheaper fees than atomic exchange 3rd party facilitators, and bridges incompatible chains.\n\nThe LN channels can be as permanent as the users want.  It simplifies trading back and forth into bitcoin and any native utility token at lower fees than WETH or WBTC.  It expands LN adoption.  Benefits utility chains as they can expect more value to come to them than leak out to bitcoin.  Adds small and frequent payment utility to bitcoin holders, and more LN adoption means more LN merchants, CEX onramps.\n\nHeadline a bit misleading, could be LN as DEFI onramp platform:  Access to what bitcoin or LN can't do.", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/mqgjwa/lightning_network_as_defi_platform_minimum_viable/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I think the bad blood which formed as a result, between those in the crypto space broadly and the IF/community, is partly why there haven't been many (non-IOTA related) experts take a look at the IF's re-imagination around how a feeless, scalable DLT could work.\n\nTo me their approach looks interesting and I'd be keen to hear how others think about it and where there may be holes in the theory (well I say theory, but there is already a testnet built with many of the components).\n\n[A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PK97KSpcI) from a few days ago is probably one of the most complete descriptions I have seen on how this new approach comes together (with the removal of the coordinator). One of the community members put together a [comprehensive set of notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IiTslHmhHim4Hkbrc7RlSmnCwsAwXUc/view) for this video (specifically of interest are sections D &amp; E from page 3 onward), which is perhaps more easily consumed, with some of it quoted below.\n\n**What they needed to come up with:**\n\n&gt;Serguei used to say we could not have a leader-based consensus mechanism, so we had to brainstorm options.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(a) A leader-based consensus protocol (BTC, for instance): there is a race to solve the cryptographic puzzle and gain the right to write to the ledger. That brings a reward, so all the nodes compete. This is something sequential, with a total order. For each block the right goes to just one miner. We wanted something more dynamic and something that might enable endless scalability.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(b) The Sybil protection mechanism they use with total-ordering ledger structure does not allow scalability.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, we started with two objectives: feeless and scalable. And that is how we came up with the idea of Mana.\n\n1. You have to think of how this could enable a more flexible network structure. The biggest problem in cryptocurrencies is that the power becomes centralized to a small number of nodes. It happens quite naturally.\n2. With mana we want to build a more complex reputation system. We want a flexible way to reward small nodes to somehow reduce the Power Law distribution where a few large nodes get too much power. This system gives us the flexibility and a countermeasure to favor good-behaving nodes and penalize bad-behaving nodes.\n\n**Leaderless architecture / parallelized transactions:**\n\n&gt;Bitcoin and Ethereum and other delegated-proof-of-stake blockchains are leader based. A leader gets elected (a specific miner or validator) that creates a new block, publishes it to the network, and then the network reaches consensus. Transaction security increases the more blocks get appended.\n\n1. That is how blockchain works today, and nearly all of the protocols ahead of us on CMC work.\n2. With IOTA, being based on a Directed Acyclic Graph, we no longer want to elect a leader, because that imposes a limit. We want to parallelize the transactions that happen and that can be confirmed.\n3. What makes IOTA so unique is we no longer have serialized consensus, but parallelized: transactions from thousands of IoT devices and people happen at the same time and the Tangle is able to scale and confirm these transactions simultaneously.\n4. One of the most important properties of IOTA is feeless transactions. One of the most difficult parts of a blockchain is the Sybil protection mechanism: how do we ensure someone does not spend infinite transactions to attack the network and double spend? Mana and rate control are our answer to prevent these attacks.\n\n&gt;Different parameters can be optimized for specific use cases, and you end up with very different architectures. For example, Solana can do tens of thousands of transactions per second, but for a very different use case than for IOTA, and it requires very specialized nodes with highly-spec’d out hardware can join their network.\n\n**Fundamental principles of the network:**\n\n&gt;Many times Bitcoin thought they had easy fixes for new applications, or to prevent certain problems, but they always mitigated with fees or other filters. With IOTA we do not want to impose any sort of fees, so we had to start with fundamental principles, for requirements to solve:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fairness, Consistency, Efficiency, and Security. These are well-known needs of networks, such as in Telecom.\n\n1. Fairness: share network access proportionally to reputation\n2. Consistency: all nodes eventually receive the same messages\n3. Efficiency: adapt resources to changing network conditions\n4. Security: attackers cannot affect any of the above requirements\n\n&gt;Consistency actually poses the biggest challenge. It is not a challenge in a standard network, but in a DLT we have a message we are trying to deliver to all nodes. If the transactions are not successfully delivered to practically all nodes it is not possible to reach full consensus. I cannot participate in a vote if I don’t know a transaction exists, or I might start building on a transaction that others do not see.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On top of all this we require complete security.\n\n**On Mana:**\n\n&gt;Mana: We need a way to decide who can have access and who can decide on transactions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a. In order to prevent a Sybil attack, we need to verify access to a scarce resource. In Bitcoin the scarce resource is hashing power. In other protocols the scarce resource is staked tokens.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b. We wanted an approach that rewarded nodes depending on the work they are doing. When a transaction is issued there is some mana created, proportional to the number of tokens being shared. The transaction can decide to which node to pledge the mana (most of the time it would just reward the node that is doing the work, since it did the work of signing the transaction, etc. but we have the possibility of rewarding a different node). Without this an attacker could create infinite identities to participate in a voting mechanism, or could create nodes to send transactions at an infinite rate without any control. We need a way to split the cake between participants.\n\n**Mana as spectrum / for rate control :**\n\n&gt;Mana draws a perfect comparison to the frequency spectrum. We have a limited spectrum that we divide between TV, radio, the military, etc. We think about we distribute this limited resource. The winners of the Nobel Prize in economics this year won for their solution of “spectrum auctions.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a. Fairness, consistency, efficiency, and security also apply to spectrum auctions. We are applying similar principles from past protocols (like Telecom) and adapting them to this new decentralized world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b. Mana is an auction mechanism. You hold iota tokens, which makes you a participant in the network and in the auction because you can generate mana.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;c. Mana is the rate control that determines how the scarce resource (transaction throughput) should be distributed according to the requirements of fairness, consistency, efficiency, and security.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;d. This is the first time that we have a completely new congestion control mechanism, not tried by any other DLT. Mana is one of the most exciting concepts of Coordicide: it proves that IOTA is evolving from just being a cryptocurrency to being a real piece of technology.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The flexibility that gives us mana is amazing. I can rent my mana, for example. It makes IOTA extremely different.\n\nAnyway, these are just some of the parts which stood out to me as exciting and quite different to most other cryptocurrency projects.\n\nI would be curious to hear the thoughts of those in this sub as a long time reader (first time poster, I think?).\n\n**\\[Addendum\\]** A few have suggested the above is buzzword heavy or a word salad, which may be my fault for quoting those bits I found most relevant for putting together the final pieces in my head. You could watch the video linked above, instead of reading the cliff notes, or there is more about Mana in these posts from the IF and those with the capability could review the implementation in the post coordicide testnet:\n\n[https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-6f636690b916/](https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-6f636690b916/)\n\n[https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-part-2/](https://blog.iota.org/explaining-mana-in-iota-part-2/)\n\n[https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer)", "lang": null, "likes": 40, "replies": 45, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/m9sli5/iotas_novel_approach_to_consensus_parallelized/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

With the creation of smart contracts  it became much easier to program blockchains to do much more. As a result a huge number of decentralised apps have been born out of the Ethereum ecosystem. When Ethereum and solidity were first created the goal was to create a 'world computer', a Turing complete decentralised network that was flexible enough to allow pretty much anything to be coded on it. This was an ambitious view and from the perspective of the developers at the time would open up countless possibilities of things that could be decentralised in the future. At the time, nobody knew what the future of cryptocurrency would be like and people didn't know that Defi would become what it is now.\n\nUsually there is a trade off when building something for general purposes vs building something for specific purposes. General purpose solutions are broad in their scope and usually perform specific tasks worse than a solution which is specifically built for that task. This is one of the disadvantages of the \"world computer\" model\n\n**How are Turing machines and Finite state machines relevant to Smart Contracts?**\n\nIf a computer is Turing complete then theoretically it could simulate anything, the caveat being that this is true given enough time. Some simulations could take longer than the lifespan of the universe to complete but theoretically the computer will eventually be able to simulate them. Solidity is a Turing complete language.\n\nWhile a language like solidity allows for a large degree of flexibility and possibilities, coding smart contracts on solidity can get complex and there is less specificity. By providing the ability to code anything there are also more possible ways the code can go wrong.\n\nFinite state machines (FSMs) are a class of machines that have a finite number of possible states and can only be in one of these possible states at any point in time (hence the name). A finite state machine is more restricted than a Turing machine. There are things that can be coded in a Turing machine that cannot be coded in a Finite State machine however the advantage being that the limited number of states mean that each set of inputs has a specific set of outputs it can produce. \n\nWhile Turing complete machines have an infinite number of states a program can be in, which grants them their flexibility. A large number of these states  are \"error\" states, and because the possible number of states are infinite it is hard to avoid errors when programming apps. A finite state machine limits the number of \"error\" states so they are much easier to find and there is a lower probability of encountering one.\n\nThe advantage this provides is greater predictability and simplicity. By reducing the amount of possibilities coding becomes more simple, faster and less prone to things going wrong.\n\n**How does this relate to smart contract exploits?**\n\nBased on the above, the Turing completeness of solidity and Ethereum has created some risk factors when coding apps for DeFi. The flexibility and infinite states solidity provides make it incredibly difficult for developers to avoid error states for certain, this issue is magnified when multiple DeFi apps are combined together.\n\nThis is evident by the large amount of exploits and hacks in DeFi smart contracts recently leading to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of losses. \n\n**How Radix addresses exploits and hacks**\n\nRadix was built specifically to cater to the needs of DeFi, the developers were aware of the issues with security in DeFi along with many others. To minimise the exploit problem, instead of using a Turing complete language. Radix uses Scrypto, its own FSM language which will allow easier and safer deployment of financial apps, based on the advantages described above. By using a FSM language the probability of unexpected exploits caused by \"error\" states on Radix is greatly reduced, and because the possibilities are finite it is much easier to check what could go wrong in a contract and prevent it.\n\n**The Radix component catalogue**\n\nThe input-output structure of FSMs like Scrypto allows components to be built on Radix. Components are pieces of code with a specific function that can be reused by app developers for example a token minting component, a liquidity pool component or a token swapping component. These components can be used as building blocks by app developers to save time. Instead of writing code from scratch for specific actions they can just use a trusted pre-existing component to both save time and reduce fears of coding errors. \n\nOne last benefit of this component catalogue which is unrelated to security is the royalty system. Radix has a royalty system in place to reward developers for building good and useful components. When a component is built and added to the catalogue the creator of it receives royalties every single time it is used, incentivising developers to build on Radix by providing them an opportunity to earn royalties for life thus fuelling the growth of the Radix ecosystem.\n\n**But doesn't using a FSM limit the use cases of Radix?**\n\nDifferent FSMs have different levels of complexity, a traffic light system is a simple example of a FSM. A self driving car system is a more complex FSM. Radix has enough flexibility and complexity to be used for a wide range of financial,  and other application use cases. Almost all use cases of crypto that currently exist today (NFTs, DEX's, token minting etc) will all be possible to code on Radix. The FSM environment is flexible enough to support the main relevant use cases of crypto while still providing security and ease of coding. As a proof of concept a decentralised twitter is even being built as a demo on a proof of concept version of Radix.\n\nTo paraphrase the words of founder Dan Hughes \"you could code a flight simulator on Ethereum but not on Radix\" For most use cases of DLT technology Radix will be suitable, there may be a few niches in the future it isn't suited to but there is more than enough value in the markets and use cases it does cover.", "lang": null, "likes": 33, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/lw1mrh/preventing_smart_contract_exploits_on_radix/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

It’s finally back.\n\nPrivacy has always been in the spirit of NavCoin. Our old nomenclature, NavajoCoin, was a homage to the American Navajo tribe of code talkers, who played a crucial role assisting the Marines during the WWII. Their performance excelled that of the existing code-breaking machines at the time. We wanted to translate that excellence into a cryptocurrency, as we rapidly saw the unsuitability of public blockchains when securing the access to our own financial data. Our goal was to create a value-transfer system which protected the privacy of its users.\n\nBack in 2016, we presented the innovative NavTech, our first privacy solution. Users were able to operate their own mixing nodes, making them collect fees from transactions while providing liquidity for others to shuffle their coins with. Since the release of NavTech, we aimed to improve the system we designed. We sat down and started to research how we could refine it.\n\nThere were mainly two weak points in our previous protocol. NavTech appealed to the use of denominations (breaking a whole amount in different multiples) in order to obfuscate the value transacted. While hard to reconstruct the exact amount for a human observer, it was proven that the use of mathematical heuristics could help to link the two sides of a transaction by establishing connections based on how the amounts were split.\n\nA second weak point was the fact that NavTech required trust in the individuals who acted as operators of the mixing nodes. This did not align with our purpose of building trustless decentralised technologies.\n\n2020 just came to an end. It took us 4 years to bring to fruition a substitute for NavTech. Our new privacy proposal, xNAV, solves the aforementioned issues and opens new exciting doors for the future of NavCoin.\n\nThanks to blsCT, our novel self-developed cryptographic protocol, not only amounts are now obfuscated in a way that observers can’t elucidate the value transacted, but also both the sender and receiver of a transaction. The new private token xNAV and its mixing protocol built on top of blsCT, make the whole network of NavCoin nodes operate as an indestructible decentralized mixing network with no trust involved. This is a major improvement compared to NavTech.\n\nThe additional scalability advances result of the aggregation capabilities of BLS signatures and the support for scripting and smart contracts make us very excited about the potential of xNAV. A whole range of applications will be able to profit from its privacy enhancing features. We are looking forward to see NAV and xNAV integrated in some of the most exciting DeFi tools.\n\nRead more [here](https://medium.com/nav-coin/the-future-of-nav-as-a-privacy-coin-starts-today-76d329ac818a).", "lang": null, "likes": 13, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/kq6xph/the_future_of_nav_as_a_privacy_coin_starts_today/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I posted it other places and generally got the misconception that this is about e-voting. It isn't. I am not attempting to solve any problems of e-voting.\n\nThe idea is to link time with an opinion, to curate content, or make decisions collectively. It's a baseline skeleton for building fair collaborative systems.\n\nAlso the biometric part is purely optional!!! I don't plan to use it in my own Web 4 apps. It's like a fun bonus idea, and I may remove it from the final draft.\n\nAll Love,\n\n- Douglas\n\nP.S. Going out to eat Tacos now, will reply when I get home!! \n\n\n# The Web 4 Manifesto: Awakening the Democratic Web \n\nWeb 4 is a set of four **modular paradigms** (time tokens, biokeys, information entropy, and geo-social systems) that allow integration of **provable democracy in any social system** that seeks to be more collaborative (organization, government, community, etc.). Modularity allows any project to adopt one or more of these principles to **increase the accuracy, fairness, and transparency** of each individual's role in **collaboration**. \n\nWeb 4 is **built on top of web 3** (it's blockchain-based) while being **fundamentally different** and providing enough **benefit to society** warrant the new title of web 4. \n\nIn essence, web 4 is **collaboration consensus tool** that helps to manifest a shared desire, opinion, or solution by providing a fair system of accounting using time-limited votes, real people, and existing geopolitical stratification.\n\n&gt; Web 4 combines real-world components like time and geography with existing blockchain technology.\n\nIn this manifesto, I will define each of the **components** of web 4, provide **psudeocode** to illustrate the minimum integration into web 2/3, introduce the **benefits to society**, and offer a **roadmap** to adopting these concepts.\n\n# The Problem\nDemocracy, society's biggest and most successful consensus and collaboration mechanism, has become **too slow to keep up** with the modern world. Groups of people organizing, whether to turn a profit as a company, or to live together in a city, are often **under-, mis-, or not represented at all** in the decision making processes that affect their lives and work. In both governments and companies it is the few that make the decisions for the many, even with the **illusion** of \"having a say\" that exists in a **representative system**. \n\n# The Solution\nBy providing each individual with **equal power** in a **transparent decision making process**, the true intent of the majority can not only be known, it can be acted upon in predetermined ways through smart contracts. Though this solution seems simple, there are issues that will need to be addressed according to the needs of each group of collaborating people, such as ensuring **one person per account**, and **limiting the minting of voting tokens with time**, as well as protecting the **privacy of decision makers** where appropriate. This paper will detail these solutions, and recommend that each system decide what components of web 4 to use or not use. For example, systems can (and should) be built using time tokens that **do not use biometric data at all**, a common concern in our modern world. \n\n\n# Background\n\nBefore we detail web 4, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1, web 2, and web 3. \n\n - **Web 1**\n**Static web**. Files are served from a remote server to a user's browser.\n\n - **Web 2**\n**Dynamic web**. Web pages take a user's information and desires into account to build a unique experience for them. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central server.\n\n - **Web 3**\n**Decentralized web**. Applications, often open-source, exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and autonomy. \n\n - **Web 4**\n**Democratic web**. Time-limited tokens are given to each individual, and used as a measure of opinion or desire in collaborative systems.\n\nToday, the top 100 websites/apps by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2-based. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of **corporate-owned information.** \n\nAs more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of **government, censorship, centralization and federated power**, web 3 has emerged as a powerful, provable option to shape the evolution of information and society on planet Earth. \n\nA growing portion of web 2 websites and applications today have elements of web 3, like [cryptoblogs](https://peakd.com) and [games](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games). While web 2 and web 3 can operate independently, web 3 enhances the abilities of web 2. Similarly, web 3 and web 4 can operate independently, but it makes the most sense for web 4 to be built on blockchains to gain the benefits of reliability and transparency. \n\n## Guiding Philosophy\nWeb 4 seeks to implement [biomimetic](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/) systems in **harmony with the universe itself** by replicating nature: the **abundance** of the Sun, rising **entropy**, and the **equality** of each human being. \n\nWeb 4 tests the hypothesis that when we create information systems in **harmonic resonance** with natural systems, our society will be able to advance more rapidly than ever before, as we will be able to **synchronize energetically** with the larger systems of bioelectromagnetic information processing around us (the Earth, Sun, and Galactic core). \n\n\n## Defining Web 4\nWeb 4 introduces **four modular components** for **provably democratic systems**, suggested to be built on top of web 3's open-source decentralized networks. \n\n### There are four conceptual underpinnings (modules) of web 4\n\n 1. **Time Tokens** \n\t Individuals may claim time-limited tokens at given intervals, which represent that interval. Only one time tokens can represent the one interval and individual, and one individuals can't hold another's time tokens.\n 2. **Proof of Individuality (One Person, One Account)**\n\t Biometric Secrets, Social Verification, Proof of Liveness, white lists, etc. are used to guarantee no individual can collect two time tokens for a given interval by holding two accounts. \n 3. **Information Entropy**\n\t Information degradation over time, pseudo accounts in sensitive systems\n 4. **Harmonic Geo-social Systems**\n\t Fair, transparent collaboration through accounting the opinions and desires of participants, including in existing geopolitical \n\nEach module can be used separately or in tandem. This paper invites you to involve any of these ideas into your current and future projects. We will discuss these concepts one at a time, but first let's examine why we need them in the first place. \n\n\n# Why we must grow from web 3 to evolve democracy\n&gt; Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3 as-is because there is no inherit limit over how many accounts a user may control.\n\n**Democracy** is essentially reaching a consensus with the idea that **each person is equal** in their influence on that consensus within defined bounds.\n\nMany different **consensus models** have been developed in web 3, most notably, [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work) (**POW**), [proof of stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake) (**POS**), and [delegated proof of stake ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/delegated-proof-of-stake-explained)(**DPOS**). These paradigms of consensus are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction records (blocks) is considered valid, \"securing\" a blockchain. \n\nPOS and DPOS are additionally used in projects like [**Hive**](https://peakd.com) to allow users to \"vote\" on valuable content, an early example of the democratic web. DPOS is also used for networks to determine who can access network resources, such as in [EOSIO blockchains](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md).\n\nHowever, both of these POS/DPOS use cases (curation and resource allocation) are not democratic in the sense that **each account is not equal**. In both cases, the root of democracy is in the token, not the individual, and the ownership of tokens determines the voting power or computing power held by an individual. \n\nIn the end, the only way to implement true democracy in any system is through giving **each individual equal power**. The only way to do this while keeping web 3's decentralized nature is to implement the technological and idealogical advancements needed for a **one individual,  one account** system. These advancements  are, for simplicity and communication, called web 4. \n\nLet's review the concepts one by one.\n\n___\n# **1**\n\n___\n\n# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) \n\nTime tokens may be offered or directly distributed to users' wallets periodically. They work by hashing a unique personal identifier (address) with a time identifier, **linking each token to a person and a span of time**.\n\n\n## The Gears of Time Tokens\n\nTime tokens rely on the following concepts:\n 1. **Time Tokens** \n\t Individuals may claim time-limited tokens at given intervals, which represent that interval. Only **one time token can represent the one interval and individual**, and one individual can't hold another's time tokens.\n\t These tokens provide the user with a function or action. The action burns the token, which may cause some change in the state of a system, such as minting another token, registering a vote, or any other action. Thus, **each time token is unique yet semi-fungible**. Time tokens can also be checked for freshness when needed, for example a user may have to use a certain time period's token to cast a vote in an election, which SHOULD also exclude that particular time token from all other functions. \n\t \n 2. **Time Unit**\nA time unit is an time interval that is a sub- or superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of seconds. Each time token MUST be the only one in existence stamped with a particular time unit for each user (wallet). \n\n 2. **Time Faucet**\nA time faucet is a smart contract that offers any qualified account EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user. \n\n 3. **Qualified Accounts**\nQualified accounts adhere to the individuality requirements of a given system. Each web 4 system will do this differently according to their needs, perhaps with a whitelist, social verification, biometric verification, proof of liveness, or other means. \n\n\n## How do Time Tokens work?\nTime tokens operate like non-fungible tokens in their structure, storing a time unit (integer) with a unique user identifier (string) as the payload data. \n\nThe user's identifier may also be a biocryptographic key (biokey) discussed in the next section.\n\nTime tokens are platform independent, and need only the ability to store simple data: a time unit and user identifier. \n\nIn practice, a time unit is an integer that counts up the number of pre-defined time spans that have passed since an **epoch**. The epoch is typically when the system went live, and represents 0 in the first time interval. \n\n## Time Tokens in practice\n\nIf we were to create a time token for a US citizen to vote in the **US presidential election**, the time span would be 126144000 seconds (four years), and the epoch would be at a timestamp representing the start of the **election day previous to the first election** to use time tokens. On election day, an active faucet would send one time token to each registered voter (aka Qualified Account) with a payload of the user's **unique identifier and the integer 1 as the time unit** (the next election would be 2, and so on.) The user would then send the token to the election's smart contract address with a **memo of their vote**. The system would check the identity of the voter, validity of the memo, and the time unit against their list to ensure they are voting in the correct election, **burn the token** (or else reverse the transaction if malformed), and send the user back another token representing a **\"I Voted\" sticker**. \n\n&gt; This example intentionally doesn't account for anonymity\n\n**This example is trivial.** It becomes beneficial when we realize that we can just as easily send the person 12 voting tokens so they can vote on their first, second and third choice. It becomes even more interesting when we send tokens **every month** (or so) and allow the people to **vote directly on the bills that are being presented to their respective legislative bodies**. It becomes even more expansive when we have the faucet smart contract require **educational actions**, such as opening a link to information on these bills (summary and the full text) **to receive their time tokens**. \n\n## A Simple Example in web 2\n\nHere is the minimum information stored in a time token, using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/) as an example\n```\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n  },\n  \"payoadData\": {\n    \"time-unit\": 294957,\n    \"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\"\n  }\n}\n```\nBelow is a brief pseudocode example of how one could use a signed time token as a JWT.\n\nSee Appendix A for more detailed pseudocode of a time token. \n```\nconst passedBioData = {..} // biodata from user\n\nconst header = {\n        \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n        \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n      }\n\nconst payloadData = {\n\t\"time-unit\": \"294957\", \n\t\"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\", \n\t\"appData\": {\n\t\t\"gold\": 479,\n\t\t\"honey\": 23,\n\t\t\"axe\": 0 \n\t}\n}\n\nconst bioKey = bioKeyGenerator(passedBioData); // Biometric provider's key or one generated direcly by user\n\n// --- Here we have the signature, to be used for any purpose --- \\\\\nsignature = HMACSHA256(\n\tbase64UrlEncode(header) + \".\"+\n\tbase64UrlEncode(payloadData), \n\tbioKey\n)\n\n\nfunction bioKeyGenerator(bioData){\n\t// Function takes data in the form of user input into their browser or smartphone.\n\t// Data is normalized (explained in Appendix A, not shown here)\n\tbioKeyChecked = bioData;\n\t// Return biokey \n\treturn sha256(bioKeyChecked)\n}\n\n\n```\nThe notable parts here are the `time-unit` and `userid` in the payload, and the `bioKey` which is generated by a user's biometric data.\n\nWe have said we web 4 is based on web 3 (blockchain), but this example intentionally used  **web 2 technology**. Much of the rest of this paper goes over ways to avoid trust by incorporating biometric data in a specific way, but that's not always needed, or helpful. We have to trust a government to run our elections. We have to trust social media platforms with our photos. We have to trust the Sun will rise, and a. giant meteor won't crash into Earth. \n\nThe truth is, **all systems have some level of trust**, even if that's just in the system itself. If we try to get rid of this trust by implementing a system so good we are our own private key, it can backfire, and when it does, if we built it because we were fearful instead of trusting, that's super lame. \n\nWhile I'm going to lay out a possible solution to use biometrics in a \"trustless\" way that fits with web 3 ideals, I don't personally think it's a good idea, and I won't be designing my Web 4 apps with it for quite some times, if ever. \n\n___\n# **2**\n\n___\n\n# **Proof of Individuality - Biokeys + Biosecrets**\n&gt; **Please Note:** There are solutions available today (like [FaceTec](https://www.facetec.com/) and [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/)) that solve the same issues presented here. This paper seeks to outline a web 3-based system (decentralized + open source) that can run without a centralized actor, while not providing specifics to accomplish these goals. This is more of a thought experiment than a suggestion or requirement. \n\n**Biometric secrets (biosecrets)** are akin to any cryptographic private key, but they are your actual biological data, or, more specifically, a four dimensional expression of your humanness from which biometric data is collected. \n\nInstead of a private key generated alongside a public key, **a hash of quantized biometric data becomes your public key**, which is paired with your **actual flesh-and-blood-and-sound-and-movement-data, your private/secret key**, or as we call it \"**biosecret**\" which isn't stored on any server or blockchain. \n\n## Keys  \n1. **Biosecret**: A biosecret is a specific biometric expression that is quantized using cartesian grids into data points with a precision that makes it replicable for the individual in the future, but impossible for another person to duplicate, even an identical twin.\n\n2. **Biokey**: The biometric information that makes up a biosecret is hashed into a public biokey, making the original biometrics practically impossible to reconstruct for a biokey.\n\n\n\n## How this can go wrong\nIn today's biometric space, static images are most commonly used for things like fingerprint and facial recognition, and geometry is the means to compare this data. Biometric secrets generated from static images are not secure, as static images can be faked. [2] Video offers a better solution to this problem, as it is harder to fake, can include audio, and lets developers create a whole new set of algorithms based on a changing stream of data. [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/) is one company using video for biometric verification. \n\n\n## What could be used to generate a biokey?\nThis stream of data (video + audio biometric expression) could be a user doing a series of hand gestures, singing a part of a song, speaking a phrase, speaking a phrase in different voices, clapping, making a series of facial expressions or movements, or anything else one can imagine.\n\nFor security, biometric expressions (used to make a biokey) must be unique (for example, which combination of words to speak) and many types must be available (gestures, movement, singing, clapping, etc) and used in combination. **If each person's biokey was generated from the same single biometric expression, it would be a matter of time before specific AI could be developed to deepfake it for anyone**. If the user is the only one that knows their biometric expressions it becomes nearly impossible to guess the type and nature of the expression, and even if that is known, difficult to use the same technique on more than one account. The nature of the uniqueness could be chosen by the user, or generated at random from the biokey software which would prompt the user to complete an action in a specific way. \n\n## Why do we need this, again?\nDemocratic systems certainly are being built without biometric verification, and will continue to be even after suitable biometric technology develops along the open source, client-side requirements. For now, **decentralized solutions** like [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), and centralized tech like [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/FaceTec_3D_Face_Matching_Whitepaper.pdf) provide the necessary individuality at the cost of trust and requirement of citizenship. Additionally, **biometric data can be avoided entirely** by using a social verification platform like [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) As different projects implement web 4 in their own ways, the ideas presented thus far will develop as flaws are found. And there's always the ability to use a whitelist, the most low-tech, high-trust, and simplest solution.\n\n## Trust Issues\nThe biggest issue with biometrics is the lack of trust the general population has (or should have) with giving up their biometric data, including the growing number of facial recognition softwares and databases. The lack of trust is almost always associated with an individual's **lack of clear consent**, and lack of understanding the technology itself. \n\n### To alleviate the trust issue, biokey generators must be: \n1) **open-source**\n2) entirely run on the individual's hardware (**client-side**), and \n3) **not expose any biometric data** to any other users or to a web 4 system itself (the biosecret is never stored or transmitted in any way). \n\nThere will always be **security concerns** with biometrics. For example, if a user uses their biometric secret to unlock their mobile device, another app could be secretly recording the camera in the background. A person could record them doing their secret, and try to play that video back to the camera to gain access. Also, *[deepfakes](https://github.com/aerophile/awesome-deepfakes) exist*. These concerns must be addressed before this module of web 4 reaches mass adoption. \n\nThe upside of biosecrets is they **cannot be lost**, and the account will always be **recoverable by the individual**. In a web 4 ecosystem, where the tokens are distributed daily and often spent daily, a hack would be much less catastrophic. The attacker will be able to access the user's balance, but not alter the past transactions, nor continue to collect the future deposits, because the real user will (in theory) quickly recover the account and change the biometric secret generation means so that the hacker's biofake is no longer working. \n\n___\n# **3**\n\n___\n\n##  Information Entropy\nWeb 3 focuses on storing information forever in a provable way. Web 4 introduces a **counter-model** which may be **optionally** adopted by any time-token-based system. In this model, who did what becomes **harder and harder to know** the more time that passes. \n\nThis idea hinges upon incremental time units, the number of which is used to decide how difficult information about a particular individual is to access. This can be implemented by increasing the difficulty required to verify a transaction chain, or economically by increasing the fees associated with accessing or interacting with old transactions or smart contracts. \n\nWith **information entropy**, it is difficult, but not impossible, to piece together a story about an individual user by knowing they are responsible for a set of transactions over time. The further back in time a transaction is, the **harder** it is to link it to another transaction with any **certainty**. \n\n## Information Entropy and Biosecrets\nInformation fidelity requirements can also be degraded over time. For example, when generating a user's biokey, it can be assumed that the more time that passes, the more the biometrics of the individual will change. \n\n### Degradation of Biokeys\n**Biokeys** are generated from a **range of biometric values**. This range of values can be expanded over time based on specific, well researched paths. The effect is, instead of having one hashed biokey for eternity, the generation process will create a set of biokeys from an increasingly **wide range of data**. This concept may be needed to keep people in control of their accounts as they age. There is considerable work to be done to develop this concept, as each data type has its own considerations and complications. \n\nIn this case, as time goes on, someone attempting to prove their individuality would have to spend a lot **more effort** to run the algorithms against their collected biodata, and the data **precision** needed to match the person's identity is actually **lower**. This is one example of **fidelity change**; others can make it more expensive to change a record from the past, make it harder to find out the ID of a voter, or even limit a past state's effect on the future of a blockchain. \n\n## Proceed with Caution \nWhile the inclusion of this concept into web 4 may seem **unnecessary** at the moment, it is another guarantee of the privacy that is needed for many **social applications**. Philosophically, degradation of information also fits in with the general web 4 desire to reflect [systems in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics). \n\nBefore moving on, I do wish to stress the modularity of web 4, and that this (perhaps the most radical idea presented) is not going to fit into every web 4 system, nor should it. This idea will find its usefulness when it is time, and should NOT be adopted without clear reasoning. \n\n\n___\n# **4**\n\n___\n# Geo-Social Systems: Geotribes + Geodomains\n\nThe geo-social systems apt to be improved by web 4 are those which involve **people collaborating**, like government/legislation, food and water management, community projects, education, events, charities, environmental protection and more. Web 4 can also be used by organizations so employees can have a direct say in the actions and direction of their companies and non-profits.\n\nCollaborative geo-social systems are always happening everywhere humans live. Currently, we are collectively deciding what direction we should be moving as a society, from representative governments, to social media. However, human growth in the past few centuries has been focused on technological improvements rather than social improvements. [3] To harness the power of the information age for the collaboration of humans, web 4 should be used to enhance, introduce, and replace current structures that organize our societies. \n\n&gt; Web 4 proposes that systems based in time token are the most apt to create and improve existing social layers. \n\n## What is a Geo-Social System?\n\nA geo-social system is something that affects people (**social**) at a given bounded area (**geo**). To refer to a group of people associated with a certain area, we'll call them a **geotribe**, and to refer to that area we'll call it a **geodomain**. \n\n## Concepts\n\n1. **Geodomain**: A bounded area that has an associated group of people who are running a democratic (web 4) system. \n\n2. **Geotribe**: The group of people associated with a geodomain that are participants in a web 4 system.\n\nGeodomains can be nested, with a finite set of smaller areas making up the larger area, common in geopolitics, but this is not required. Geodomains can also be overlapping or non-overlapping.\n\n\n## Creating Geo-social Systems\nTo create a geo-social system, we first must define the requirements of the geodomain, and then the requirements for an individual to be a part of the geotribe within that geodomain. \n\n### Geodomain Stratification  \nAcross the globe, **one geopolitical pattern** seems to emerge, though names vary. Cities are within Counties, are within States, are within Nations, are within the World. \n\n1. Cities (aka Towns, Commonwealths, etc.)\n2. Counties (aka Divisions\n3. States (aka Districts, Provinces)\n4. Nations (aka Countries, States, Republics, etc)\n5. Global\n \n&gt; Additionally, a **community level** may be added within cities to further add accuracy and usefulness. \n\nUsing this existing geopolitical stratification is recommended for those wishing to build a web 4 system because it makes varying global systems easily storable in a one relational database model or similar data structure, and is understood by local people, governments, etc. \n\nOnce we have our geodomains, we must define what makes a geotribe.  \n\n### Geotribal Bonds\nTraditionally, it's the existence within a certain area, such as a place of residence or business, that is of importance for things like taxes, voting, and citizenship. When building a geo-social system, it's only necessary that an association is declared that is relevant for that system, which may or may not involve proving residency. \n\nIt is important for every system that each individual only exist within one geotribe (excluding those extrapolated) so that their vote isn't counted twice. \n\nWhen using stratified geodomains, such as geopolitically-based ones, only the deepest level of association is needed (city/community), from which the rest can be extrapolated.\n\nIf a geopolitically-based geodomain system allows geotribe members to declare their own associated location without proof, the member is incentivized to be honest, as they will receive the most benefit from having their opinion heard where it matters to them. \n\nAll \"non-proof\" systems should place restrictions on switching voluntarily-given geodomain association too often (such as once per 6 months) to prevent influencing foreign affairs. \n \n\n# High-Fidelity Democracy \n\nBy offering time tokens to the individual that correspond to each stratum we can create **high-fidelity democratic systems** that better represent each and every person's desires. We can know exactly what the people want, with no guesswork and 0 middlemen, in a very short period of time. \n\nFor example, a person may be given 12 time tokens per month at each stratum to vote on the initiatives that they would like to see passed. They may vote all 12 tokens for an initiative they are most passionate about, or 1 token to 12 different initiatives (or 2 to 6 initiatives, etc). By collecting and counting these tokens, the governing body can **know exactly what their constituents want**, without the direct need to elect a representative who only estimates these desires. \n\nThe democratic system described in this paper does not solve all problems, as there are still issues of voter informedness, unseen actors, and more, but it is a skeleton to build a collaborative social system that are an **improvement to the representative governments** which were once as revolutionary as these ideas are. \n\n\n# Roadmap to Web 4 Reality\n\n## **Phase One**\n&gt; Implementing time tokens\n\n**Time Tokens** are implemented on any and all blockchains where developers see the value. These developers provide open-source instructions and tools to helps other developers incorporate time tokens into their applications. \n\n**Provable individuality** for Time Tokens is up to each application and blockchain, and these application can choose to ignore this requirement, risking their systems' integrity. **Federated** (Facetec) and **decentralized** (Civic) options may be used, and so can social verification (BrightID).\n\n**Information entropy** and **geo-social systems** are starting to be theorized, but not showing up. \n\n**Phase 1 Action Points**: \n- Time Token ERC proposal on Ethereum (and similar for other blockchains)\n- Developers exploring use cases for Time Tokens \n\n\n## **Phase Two**\n&gt; dApps and discovering issues\n\n**Applications using Time Tokens** are widespread, and issues in implementations are becoming known and solved. Developers who open time token faucets are seeing their token be used in third-party apps in ways they didn't foresee. \n\n**Provable identity issues** are becoming apparent, as certain applications with **lax rules** are being manipulated, showing the need for true provable identity. The best solutions are becoming known alongside the problems.\n\n**Information entropy** principles are starting to be implemented, when required.\n\n**Geo-social systems** are starting to be built, but not used for \"real applications\" like running a government because of lack of true provable individuality, and social inertia.\n\n**Phase 2 Action Points**: \n- Proposing the best uses for geo-social systems using time tokens\n- Incorporating different provable identity methods\n- Developers implementing Time Token in unexpected ways\n\n## **Phase Three**\n&gt; Implementing Provable Identity\n\n**Provable Identity** is now possible as suggested in this manifesto through the maturity of the biometric secrets. Standards are being created openly, or, it is decided that the way presented here is not needed as a better way is found.\n\n**Geo-social systems** are being used to run and govern communities which are not dependent on traditional representative government. Existing governments are adopting time tokens to get a better read on what legislation the people want. \n\nOrganizations of all sizes are using time tokens to shift power to employees. \n\n**Phase 3 Action Points**: \n- Picking provable identity solutions that satisfy all requirements\n- Possibly abandoning biometric system presented here\n- Communities running on web 4\n- Governments benefiting from web 4\n- Organizations using web 4\n\n## **Phase Four**\n&gt; Geo-social systems\n\n**Information entropy** is added to the systems where it can be of use. For example, this could make a person's (anonymous) voting record less knowable over time by increasing the amount of CPU time needed to associate one vote with another. \n\n**Geo-social systems** are being used as a replacement for representative government where it is the will of the people. Voter informedness is measured and known, as are the exact desires of the people. This creates collaboration and a renewed faith in democracy, and a feeling of belongingness and appreciation for each individual. \n\n**Phase 4 Action Points**: \n- Building and operating geo-social systems for the benefit of society and any collaborating group\n- Exploring use cases and integrating information entropy where appropriate\n\n# Author notes\n\n## Change Without Conflict\n**No one can stop us** from building collaborative systems with web 4 and even **self-governing**. **We don't need** to \"tear down the system\" or separate from society to do so. **Web 4 can exist** fully embedded in the geopolitical systems around us, while implementing and improving the four concepts, the underpinnings of collaborative democracy.\n\nIf and when the \"old system\" meets its demise, as all things do, **we can transition rapidly** to a web 4 system like [Effective Collective](https://github.com/dougbutner/effective-collective) or any other, as this solution will already be in place. \n\n## Why use the term \"Web 4\"\nIt is my belief that each version of the web must 1) be built on top of the previous version, 2) be fundamentally different than the previous version by introducing new technology, and 3) have meaningful impact on society. \n\nThis proposal for the next iteration of the web is an effort to both expand and shift the path of information science in a direction where the **meaningful impact** of society involves: 1) empowerment of each individual, which serve as the basis for collective (social), economic, and novel applications; 2) provable identity verification while maintaining complete separation from any federated system, including government, with the side-benefit of lifelong recoverability of biokeys with biosecrets; and 3) resonance with our contained and containing systems, like our human organs and the Solar system, which provide us with life and free energy daily, akin to free time tokens.\n\nWhile an argument could easily be made that DeFi is Web 4, or another emerging tech, like \"layer 2\" blockchains (rollups) are web 4, both of these are **not new**. DeFi mimics and improves the systems of the past. Rollups are merely making web 3 **more efficient**. \n\nIt is my hope and desire that the information presented here will be **expanded** on and **implemented** by many developers and systems in the coming years, not for the benefit of the few, but for the **empowerment** of each individual and the **harmony** of the human collective, and every layer of Gaia. \n\n___\n# Notes + References\n___\n\n[1] - Solutions like Civic and Facetec have proved to be effective in verifying individuality. KYC services rely on government-issued identification, physical signature, and minimal, often human-checked bioverification.

With DeFi, developers and product teams have the flexibility to build on top of existing protocols, customize interfaces, and integrate third-party applications. For this reason, people often call DeFi protocols “money legos.”\n* **Transparency.** On the public Ethereum blockchain, every transaction is broadcast to and verified by other users on the network (note: Ethereum addresses are encrypted keys that are pseudo-anonymous). This level of transparency around transaction data not only allows for rich data analysis but also ensures that network activity is available to any user. Ethereum and the DeFi protocols running on it are also built with open source code that is available for anyone to view, audit, and build upon.\n* **Permissionless.** Unlike traditional finance, DeFi is defined by its open, permissionless access: anyone with a crypto wallet and an Internet connection, regardless of their geography and often without any minimum amount of funds required, can access DeFi applications built on Ethereum.\n* **Self-Custody.** By using Web3 wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to interact with permissionless financial applications and protocols, DeFi market participants always keep custody of their assets and control of their personal data.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 0, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/jj0nhn/benefits_of_decentralized_finance/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

The teams enabling the tokenizing of BTC on Ethereum have been embracing this belief, and it is paying off. Also, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has such a strong gravity that even BTC holders have been finding ways to use it.\n\n**COMP AND YIELD FARMING**\n\nCompound released its governance token COMP in mid-June. Tokens have been rewarded daily to borrowers and lenders on Compound. The result has been that enterprising DeFi users have been maximizing their COMP yield (i.e. “yield farming”) by using DeFi mechanisms to unlock capital and then lending/borrowing on Compound. \n\nYield farming took the DeFi ecosystem by storm in the last two weeks of the quarter. Crucial metrics like ETH locked and daily active users soared after being fairly stagnant earlier in the quarter. However, data (discussed below) suggests the frenzy did not bring many new users into DeFi, demonstrating that DeFi’s innovation must be paired with education and UX before we see the DeFi community grow beyond its current borders.\n\n**3 MAJOR SECURITY INCIDENTS**\n\nUniswap, Lendf.me, and Balancer all had high-profile security incidents this quarter, collectively resulting in $26M USD stolen (most of which was returned, discussed below).\n\nSecurity incidents are inevitable in emerging technology.

The attack was made possible because Uniswap V1 does not have measures in place to guard against this type of reentrancy attack when interacting with the ERC-777 standard. In total, the hacker made away with \\~$300k USD in imBTC and ETH (\\~$141k ETH + \\~$160k imBTC). \n\nInterestingly, this attack vector was not unknown to Uniswap or to the crypto community at large. Almost exactly a year before the Uniswap attack, [ConsenSys Diligence](http://diligence.consensys.net/) \\- the security audit service offered by ConsenSys - [identified and published](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/uniswap-audit-b90335ac007) the ERC-777 reentrancy attack vector. Uniswap had plans to address the attack vector, as outlined in their [March 23 blog post](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/) about the features of Uniswap V2.\n\nAs DeFi protocols grow in number, complexity, and interconnectedness, more security vulnerabilities and compromises are likely to occur.

The tBTC system is a bonded, multi-federated peg made up of many deposits backed by single-use BTC wallets to enable their value’s corresponding usage on the Ethereum chain, primarily through the minting of a TBTC ERC20 token whose supply is guaranteed to be backed by at least 1 BTC per TBTC in circulation.\n\nfinally this is the best:\n\nhttps://tbtc.network/developers/tbtc-technical-system-overview\n\nhere is the first few pargarphs\n\n&gt; 2020-04-01\ntBTC incorporates novel design features that carry important implications for users. This piece explains four of these: TDT receipts, multiple lot sizes, Keep's random beacon, and threshold signatures.\n\n&gt; TBTC Deposit Token (TDT)\nThe TBTC Deposit Token (TDT) is a non-fungible token that is minted when a user requests a deposit. A TDT is a non-fungible ERC-721 token that serves as a counterpart to TBTC. It represents a claim to a deposit's underlying UTXO on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n&gt; TBTC deposits can be locked or unlocked. A locked deposit can only be redeemed by the deposit owner with the corresponding TDT. Each TDT is unique to the deposit that mints it and carries the exclusive right for up to a 6 month term to redeem the deposit.\n\nalso this paragraph addresses creating wallets with the created tokens\n\n&gt; **Random Beacon for Signer Selection**\n\n&gt; The Keep network requires a trusted source of randomness to select tBTC signers. This takes the form of a BLS Threshold Relay.\n\n&gt; When a request comes in to create a signing group, the tBTC system uses a random seed from a secure decentralized random beacon to randomly select signing group members from the eligible pool of signers. These signers coordinate a distributed key generation protocol that results in a public ECDSA key for the group, which is used to produce a wallet address that is then published to the host chain. This completes the signer selection phase.\n\n\nmy take away from this is that by using side chains that a trustless, not fedeared like liquid bitcoin sidechains sold by blockstream. it uses NFT erc-721 tokens as representation of the bitccoin UTXO from the bitcoin blockchain, store it in a wallet and mint it into tBTC. given this is all smart contracts generating wallets and minting the tBTC, it does away with the need of a centralised party to provide the funds of BTC to create a wrapped erc20 version on ethereum and so should be trustles.\n\nperhaps erc20 token trading is the way to go forward. just requires wrapping of exisitng tokens. this looks promising for DeXs and DeFi if it happens. \n\nalso opens the possibiliy of multicollateral Dai (MCD) using tBTC in addition to eth and BAT. though personally i think btc should not be used in MCD. \n\nany thoughts on this? or if my understanding is off.\n\nthanks\n\nedit: got some more info from /u/px403\n\n&gt; I talked to James a bit about tBTC in Osaka, so I have a vague idea of how it works, so I might be able to explain it in a somewhat coherent way.\n\n&gt; Basically, the magic here is they reimplemented Bitcoin's SPV as an Ethereum smart contract, effectively letting them query the current state of the Bitcoin network, including validity of payments, directly in contract. Using this, they built an auction system where people can at any time claim ETH by paying BTC, or claim BTC by paying ETH. By design the spread is wide, so this isn't actually intended to be a high volume exchange, but what you do get is a pretty good price oracle.\n\n&gt; From the price oracle, I think there were doing some Maker style CDPs or something, where people could lock up their BTC on the Bitcoin network to redeem tBTC, and any of the locked BTC could be reclaimed by burning tBTC or something.\n\n&gt; Sorry it's not a complete picture of what's going on, but I think that's the general gist of what they're doing.", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/ftvjcg/tbtc_an_erc20_wrapped_version_of_btc_like_erc20/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Nano founder Colin Lemahiue's responded with this in a recent AMA with ChangeNow:\n\n&gt; Q: I really see the use case of cryptos for smart contracts. Payments only, nope.\n\n&gt; A: Smart contracts can’t cause side effects to happen. They can’t move property and they can’t negotiate unforeseen disputes. When you carefully look at it, all smart contracts take the form of a prepayment and slow release of locked-up funds. People haven’t and won’t use this for multiple reasons. Economically the opportunity cost of locked-up funds means they can’t be used elsewhere while locked up. From a practical standpoint, something simple like a rental smart contract could mean you’d have to lock up your year’s rent to slowly trickle out to your landlord. People simply don’t have this much money to lock up. Smart contracts can’t sample unforeseen circumstances, something like a judge ruling in contradiction to a smart contract means it will continue to operate incorrectly given the new situation. Oracles in smart contracts will very quickly become infeasible. Consider writing a contract about a building in a remote town, who is the person that’s going to go on location, make the determination, and feed the input into the system? How are we sure they aren’t coerced to lie?\n\nI think smart contracts do have some uses like for decentralized fair gambling and gaming where you lock up funds just for short periods of time, but maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves thinking they are world changing.\n\nThoughts?", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/f2dt9f/are_smart_contracts_and_defi_really_that_useful/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

This function call required the user to pay fees in ETH.\nIn the new MCD Dai token, a new contract function was introduced by Maker under the name of “permit”. This function allows the user to make an allowance to any address via a meta-transaction (signed message) instead of a manual transaction. The gas fees for this transaction can be subsidized by a relayer.\n\n... few paragraphs down, \n\n&gt; The Gasless contract regulates the relationship between the Mosendo relayer and the user while ensuring that the relayer is trustless by only accepting meta-transactions that are authenticated by the user via signed messages. In exchange for its service, the relayer is also paid a Dai fee by the user in order to cover the transaction gas cost and running cost of the relayer infrastructure.\n\nThis is compatible with metamask and perhaps the new browser \"Web3\" wallets, opera and brave are the first desktop ones to support it natively without extension. though the wallet is quite basic compared to metamask.\n\nThe Web3 term makes me cringe as a dev, as it reminds me of \"web 2.0\" a few years back; which was really just an improvement of front end frameworks e.g. angular and backend API perforamnce, and more generally evolution of the tech css / ease of layout tech (bootstrap) etc. \n\nI see web3 as pretty much a browser with a the ability to interact with blockchain, and thats with a wallet.

So far I've only found [Blockchain at Berkeley\n](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5sgoRfoSp3jeX4DEqKLwKg), [IOHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w) (probably biased towards Cardano) and for news related stuff [Ivan on tech](https://www.youtube.com/user/LiljeqvistIvan) (who's one of the few daily crypto youtubers that's not a complete idiot). \n\nIf somebody knows more resources especially university lectures and the like, please share it here!", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 11, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/88d4cb/what_are_good_youtube_channels_podcasts_or_moocs/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}
{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "86wfhl", "author": "Neophyte-", "handle": "Neophyte-", "created_utc": 1521929531.0, "text": "Noticed the huge rise of EOS lately what does it have over NEO and ethereum and to a lesser extent Cardano? I tried researching it, but wasn't sold. I tried to research the differences, but i dont really see anything that makes it a huge selling point over NEO in particular, and ethereum is improving with a solid road map, plasma and sharding for example. \n\nIn terms of consensus, I see that EOS is using dPoS, but eth is moving to PoS anyway, NEO uses dBFT which is faster anyway. On that note, is dPoS dangerous? delegating block creation to a few nodes makes me wonder if changes to EOS may be hard to implement e.g. a delegate decides they don't like risking a hard fork, or is this a moot point and not a risk with dPoS?\n\nWhat EOS has is 0 transaction fees, so thats a good pro in their book. they also talk about the async nature of their dApp communication with transactions. but who cares? i think this pattern is easily implemented in other dApp protocols, i think its analogous to async / await patterns you see in programming langauges .net and the new ECMA standard, im sure other langauges have the same thing. \n\nI noticed that EOS is limiting the \"chattyness\" on there launch, dApps can only have 40 messages in a transaction (i read this last night, so i'm probably not articulating this correctly). This seems to be a way to ensure the network is not bogged down by dApps, but i dont think its the right way to go about it. I think allowing off chain processing like ethereum is planning with plasma much better. thats just my thinking, i could be way off, so correct me if im wrong.\n\nOn that note of chattyness, how is cpu, transactions, memory usage controlled to handle the network? we have GAS in ethereum. How does it work in EOS? I couldn't find an answer.\n\nWhen it comes to programming languages, im not too fussed, they are promoting that their languages in EOS compile into c++, which is great. but solidity has great performance too. Infact, i think the programming languages available to build a dApp is over rated as a selling point. you can compile into native with many languages. You do have the special case with functional langauges like Haskell in Cardano, functional langauges generally lead to code that has less bugs, much steeper learning curve than imperative languages however, but i dont see that as being a problem.\n\nOverall, I don't see massive pros in EOS vs NEO and Ethereum (with its upcoming changes). Cardano i mentioned because it has a great white paper, but at this stage they havent delivered much and might be too late.\n\nI know this is a DYOR, but whats the rollout like for EOS? I don't believe its a working product yet, while NEO and Eth are. The thing with smart contracts protocols is that they can just implement ideas from other smart contract coins, however its always good to have these from the begining, to avoid forks. But even so i think the network effect of Eth and NEO will dominate the space unless EOS and Cardano can get in quick with a good use case to use them as a dApp platform, as NEO and Eth will improve over time. Of course people could migrate their dApp later when a better smart contract platform comes around. but i imagine thats not easy when you've already established yourself on one dApp platform (am i wrong?)\n\nthoughts? I'm scratching my head at why it just blew up. Doesnt seem to offer anything mind blowing over existing working product smart contract coins.", "lang": null, "likes": 53, "replies": 53, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/86wfhl/noticed_the_huge_rise_of_eos_lately_what_does_it/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}
{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "7znnq8", "author": "tracyspacygo", "handle": "tracyspacygo", "created_utc": 1519388594.0, "text": "My brief observation of most common Consensus Algorithms I have studied most common consensus algorithms. Here is the summary, maybe for someone it will be helpful. My goal is to describe every specific consensus briefly so everyone can easily understand it. *Please let me know if I have wrote something wrong, or maybe you are aware of interesting algorithm, I have missed.\n\n[Proof of Work] - very short, cuz it's well-known.\n\n[1] Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.\n\nOthers: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.\n\n[Hybrid of PoW and PoS]\n\n[2] Decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. Blocks are created about every 5 minutes. Nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (PoW). Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution. Stakeholders who have locked some DCR in return for a ticket* now have the chance to vote on the block (PoS). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. Both miners and voters are compensated with DCR : PoS - 30% and PoW - 60% of about 30 new Decred issued with a block. * 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. Stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets. \n\n[Proof of Stake]\n\n[3] Nxt - The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.\n\n[4] Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.\n\n[5] Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity) - quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.\n\n[6] Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism\" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.\n\n[7] Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake) - Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -&gt; At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -&gt; Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -&gt; As &gt;51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.\n\n[8] Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake) - Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -&gt; Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -&gt; Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -&gt; Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.\n\n[9] Tezos (Proof Of Stake) - generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. At the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -&gt; Using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to Follow The Satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle*. -&gt; Blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). \nMining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing.\n* the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer.\n\n[10] Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by &gt;2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -&gt; Prevote -&gt; Precommit -&gt; Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.\n\n[11] Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -&gt; Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -&gt; Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes &gt;2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -&gt; As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs &gt;2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -&gt; As &gt;2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.\n\n[12] NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - Consensus nodes* are elected by NEO holders -&gt; The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -&gt; He broadcasts proposal to create block -&gt; Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -&gt; Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -&gt; Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -&gt; Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-&gt; Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)\n\n[13] EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. *the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power\n\n[The XRP Ledger Consensus Process]\n\n[14] Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications -&gt; Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -&gt; Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -&gt; all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -&gt; final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -&gt; after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -&gt; All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -&gt; Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -&gt; Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.\n\n[The Stellar consensus protocol]\n\n[15] Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement) - quit similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.\n\n[Proof of Burn]\n\n[16] Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -&gt; Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.\n\n[Proof of Importance]\n\n[17] NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.\n\n[Proof of Devotion]\n\n[18] Nebulas (Proof of Devotion + BFT) - quite similar to POI, the PoD selects the accounts with high influence.  All accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (Nebulas Rank) -&gt; Top-ranked accounts are selected -&gt; Chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks Validators* -&gt; Algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block Proposer -&gt; After a new block is proposed, Validators Set (each Validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of BFT-Style voting to verify block (1. Prepare stage -&gt; 2. Commit Stage. Validators should have &gt; 2/3 of total deposits to validate Block) -&gt; Block is added. Block rewards : each Validator rewarded with 1 NAS.\n*Validators Set is dynamic, changes in Set may occur after Epoch change. \n\n[IOTA Algorithm]\n\n[19] IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -&gt; New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.\n\n[PBFT + PoW]\n\n[20] Yobicash - uses PBFT and also PoW. Nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. A node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. As follow : Node receives new transaction -&gt; Checks if valid -&gt; queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in DAG ) -&gt; queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -&gt; if everything is ok add to DAG. Reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins. \n\n[Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity]\n\n[21] Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.\n\n[Proof of Elapsed Time]\n\n[22] Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -&gt; The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -&gt; The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -&gt; Block Validators check block -&gt; Block is created on top of blockchain. \n\n[Other]\n\n[23] Byteball (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - only verified nodes are allowed to be Validation nodes (list of requirements https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness). Users choose in transaction set of 12 Validating nodes. Validating nodes(Witnesses) receive transaction fees.   \n\n[24] Nano - uses DAG, PoW (HashCash). Nano uses a block-lattice structure. Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. To add transaction user should make some HashCash PoW -&gt; When user creates transaction Send Block appears on his blockchain and Receive block appears on Recipients blockchain. -&gt; Peers in View receive Block -&gt; Peers verify block (Double spending and check if already in the ledger) -&gt; Peers achieve consensus and add block.\nIn case of Fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block):  Nano network resolves forks via a  balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as &gt;50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the Node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded). \n\n[25] Holochain - uses distributed hash table (DHT). Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. In case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every neighbor node validate it.\nAny consensus algorithms can be built on top of Holochain.\n\n[26] Komodo ('Delegated' Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. DPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize The Longest Chain Rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dPoW looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen PoW blockchain. The process of inserting backups of Komodo transactions into a secure PoW is “notarization.” Notarisation is performed by the elected Notary nodes. Roughly every ten minutes, the Notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the Komodo blockchain and take note of the overall Komodo blockchain “height”. The notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. There are sixty-four “Notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of KMD represents stake in the election. They are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.”\n\npost with references you can find here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2936428.msg30170673#msg30170673", "lang": null, "likes": 157, "replies": 48, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7znnq8/my_brief_observation_of_most_common_consensus/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

Often you can make everything look good and work now with focused optimizations, but you'll pay in the future when the solution isn't flexible or scalable enough. Alternatively you can take the time to think through all the long term needs and build a robust solution, but this can take longer and perform worse in the short run.\n\nI'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how different crypto projects approach this trade off.\n\nFor example, I think the toxic bitcoin scaling debate basically boils down to the following. **Bitcoin Core:** \"Satoshi's whitepaper and block size increases only allow for linear scaling, so increasing block sizes now will give a short term boost at the expense of long term scalability as the blockchain grows. We should prepare for other solutions.\"  **Bitcoin Cash:** \"We need on-chain scaling NOW consistent with the whitepaper or bitcoin will become unuseable and die before any other solutions can be built.\"\n\nI think Vitalik and the dev team are very conscious of the balance between short and long term with Ethereum. Instead of starting with a half-baked Proof of Stake implementation that could limit future work, they started with the tried and tested Proof of Work while developing and thinking through the implementation for the best long term Proof of Stake model. I think many Ethereum competitors (NEO, EOS, Cardano, etc) need hype and funding now, so they use designs that are very fast short term but could be at the expense of long term sustainability. I could design a super fast system that elects one node to handle all transactions and I could post videos to Reddit how excited I am to see sub 1 second transfer times between wallets. Of course this system would fail when scaled due to node bottlenecks and node election issues.\n\nAn example of a project I think is solely focused on long term at the expense of short term is IOTA. There are all kinds of usability issues and complaints with current setup, but the devs seem to be laser focused on their long term vision as an IoT protocol and aren't making many design compromises to make the system work better today. Time will tell whether they will make it to their long term vision, or if developers will switch to something like RaiBlocks that is more usable now but maybe has more questionable long term prospects.\n\nAny thoughts on other projects and the now vs future tradeoff?", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7soi7d/short_and_long_term_design_tradeoffs_in_crypto/", "subreddit": "CryptoTechnology"}

I’ve spent the last few weeks digging into Bitcoin’s performance, the macro trends behind the big moves, and a ton of alternative data that shows how public interest is changing. Here’s what I found.\n\n**1. Bitcoin’s last two years were wild.**  \nWe went from the post-FTX depression to new highs above $126k, then back down into the mid-$80k range. Even with the big pullback, the long term move is still incredibly strong.\n\n**2. The rally was mostly driven by three (maybe four) things:** \n\n* Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States finally going live\n* The 2024 halving and the predictable scarcity narrative\n* Expectations for lower interest rates and a friendlier macro backdrop\n* The new US administration is, in lack of a better word, more crypto-friendly than the former administration\n\n**3. The hedge debate is more complicated than people make it.**  \nAfter digging into studies and price behavior, my takeaway is this:  \nBitcoin can hedge long term debasement because of its fixed supply, but it does not behave like a short term hedge against the dollar. Money supply has been rising lately, but bitcoin hasn't followed. When markets de-risk, Bitcoin usually sells off in the same direction as tech stocks. Bitcoin might still protect you from a long term weak dollar, but not from short term risk-off / volatility.\n\n**4. The alternative data surprised me. Interest is cooling.**  \nThis is the part I didn’t expect to be so obvious:\n\n* Google searches for “Bitcoin” are down nearly 50 percent YoY\n* r/Bitcoin subreddit growth has slowed to just 1 percent in the last 3 months\n* Bitcoin’s Wikipedia views dropped from \\~10k per day to \\~4k\n* Sentiment across crypto forums is turning bearish\n\nIt feels like excitement has cooled even though the price is still up massively over two years. \n\n**5. What I’m watching next:**  \n• ETF inflows or outflows  \n• The Fed’s approach to rates  \n• Whether search interest and community momentum pick back up  \n• Any regulatory shifts, especially since the Trump administration has historically been more pro-crypto\n\n**My personal take:**  \nBitcoin still makes sense as a long term asset with a fixed supply and global adoption. But in the short run it behaves like a high beta macro trade, not a clean hedge. The data shows retail attention is fading, which might mean we are in the middle of a cooling phase rather than a new explosive rally.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.

Bitcoin dropped as low as $94,700 on Friday, the lowest the crypto has traded in about six months.\n\nWaning liquidity, this week's tech sell-off, and rumored selling from Strategy were adding pressure.\n\nBitcoin has been hurt amid a broader sell-off in risk assets, with tech stocks in particular getting hit hard as investors fret over high valuations.\n\nOutflows from spot bitcoin ETFs hit $866.7 million on Thursday, according to data from CoinGlass, the worst outflow bitcoin funds have seen since early August.\n\n\"In some ways, Bitcoin was a leading indicator for risk,\" David Nicholas, the CEO of XFUNDS, wrote in a note this week, pointing to recent concerns among investors about valuations in the stock market. \"I think it's the perfect recipe for Bitcoin price weakness,\" he added.\n\nBitcoin's liquidity has also dropped off over the last month, a possible reason the crypto's price has seen more volatility.\n\nBitcoin's market depth, a measure of how resistant its price is to volatility stemming from large trades, dropped from around $766 million in early October $535.2 million as of this week, according to the crypto analytics firm Kaiko.\n\nThe sell-off picked up steam on Friday as Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy and one of bitcoin's biggest cheerleaders over the years, fended off online rumors that his crypto treasury dumped some of its bitcoin holdings.\n\n\"I think the volatility comes with the territory,\" Saylor said of the latest sell-off.\n\n[Read the full story on why Bitcoin might wipe out its gains for the year here.](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-bitcoin-is-falling-btc-price-selloff-saylor-strategy-tech-2025-11?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=insider-bitcoinmarkets-sub-comment)", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ox30qv/3_reasons_bitcoin_is_on_the_brink_of_wiping_out/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Hence the recent drop.\n\nIn other words, there’s a time-frame mismatch across these assets:\n- BTC reacts almost instantly to current liquidity conditions (USD crunch due to the shutdown).\n- Equities price in future liquidity (6–12 months ahead).\n\nWhat this could mean for the future:\n\n- Bitcoin — being less institutionalized and more speculative — reacts to short-term cash flows, not forward guidance. So until liquidity returns, BTC may lag.\n- I expect the U.S. government shutdown to be resolved eventually — like previous ones.\n- If rate-cut probability remains high or the Fed actually cuts rates in October, BTC could snap upward quickly, while equities may stay relatively flat (since they’ve already priced in the easing).\n\nTL;DR: \nGold is rising as a safe-haven, equities are pricing in future liquidity/rate cuts, and Bitcoin is down because short-term USD liquidity is tight. Once the shutdown ends and rate cuts happen, BTC may rebound sharply, while stocks may stay flat.\n\n\nThis is just my take — happy to discuss the fund flows/liquidity perspective and hear other viewpoints.", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1o15c1e/october_outlook/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1o0oahe/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1mu3zrr", "author": "New-Ad-9629", "handle": "New-Ad-9629", "created_utc": 1755564522.0, "text": "Any news about balances on OTC desks (since early August)? For those who might not know, big institutions like Strategy and Blackrock buy their bitcoin 'over the counter' (OTC desks). Large trades such as these are NOT done on exchanges, and hence it doesn't affect the price. For eg, we recently heard about the [$9 billion sale of BTC](https://www.cryptoninjas.net/news/galaxy-digital-offloads-9-billion-in-bitcoin-without-triggering-a-crash/) without really moving the price on the exchanges at all. \n\nExperts can correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding of how this works is as follows: these OTC desks connect large whales (buyers and sellers) and execute the trade using the price on the exchanges at the time of the trade. For eg if the price on the exchange is $120k, the OTC trade will be carried out at this price without really affecting the price on the exchanges at all. \n\nNow the question is, what happens when the OTC supply runs out, i.e. When there are no sellers left (at the current price). The balance on OTC desks has dropped sharply, about 75% from over 400,000 coins to just above 150,000 coins. Not all the coins on the exchanges are for sale. When the demand outstrips the supply, whales will have to buy on open exchanges. This will create a [supply shock](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-demand-shock-uncork-btc-price-otc-desks-run-dry) (what everyone has been talking about for years). \n\nWhat will a supply shock look like? Well, there will be sudden increases in price, and with every new high (125k, 130k... 200k) we'll continue to see more and more sellers. The supply will never be zero, but the point is - the demand will be much much higher. \n\nI'm curious to know if anyone here has done more research on this, and can add or correct anything that I've written.

I drew a line at the valuation's bottom at 6.38 million sats per SPX. When Bitcoin pumped late last fall/ earlier winter, the S&amp;P fell bellow the 6.38 million sats level, but then something interesting happened. This level, which I doubted anyone else was watching, became resistance. Recently, however, as Bitcoin dumped, the level has become support for SPX.

Hey r/BitcoinMarkets \n\nJust wanted to share something cool I've been working on. I built an AI-powered signal for crypto futures trading. The idea was simple: tap into the incredible intelligence of advanced LLM models and let them guide my crypto trades. I've been feeding these models tons of crypto data, fine-tuning them specifically for market moves. To avoid bias from any single model, I'm actually using multiple cutting-edge LLMs and combining their predictions into one solid trading signal. All process are systematic.\n\nWhy crypto futures? Honestly, mainly because shorting is straightforward, making it easier to act quickly on signals.\n\nHere's a debut signal I put out yesterday—check it out if you're curious: [https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal](https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal)\n\nIt accurately called a short on Bitcoin with exact entry, stop-loss, and take-profit points.

These figures indicate buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. Details below:\n\nIf one can’t explain in a sentence what a company does, then it’s unlikely to be a good company. The way BTC miners make money is by acquiring BTC at lower than market value and either selling immediately (like IREN) or holding until BTC price goes up (like LSK). Personally, I do not like it when BTC miners change plans last minute. Unlike RIOT who just announced HPC-AI interest, IREN has a track record of high operational uptime (which is necessary for HPC-AI) and has provided HPC-AI services since 2019.\n\nIn a nutshell, both CLSK and IREN have higher operational uptime (Figure 2) and higher efficiency (Figure 3) than competitors RIOT and MARA. Consistently meeting quarterly goals demonstrates efficient growth by IREN and CLSK and exemplifies why these two businesses expand (gaining market share) while competitors (like RIOT and MARA) scramble to mimic others to attract investors.\n\nWhen it comes to companies holding BTC, CLSK may have more upside than others. Currently, most BTC miners have high percent shorts: CLSK (27.13%), MARA (24.12%), RIOT (19.91%), IREN (7.45%). As a rule of thumb, all shorts must eventually close positions which leads to more buy orders. BTC miners have been lagging BTC due in part to these high shorts and also by the end of year retail sell off brought on by the December federal reserve meeting. However, not every miner prioritizes shareholder value and it’s important to do your own research before buying into these higher risk stocks which are now trading at a much cheaper price.\n\nCLSK has set itself up to be most shareholder friendly BtC holder this bull run. Factors that support CLSK include NO plans for additional ATM's, full funding for growth to 50 EH/s and industry low % revenue going to compensation (Figure 4). Unlike MARA (48.4%) and RIOT (79%), IREN and CLSK have only 29.24% and 24.38% of revenue going towards paying compensation (which is good for shareholders). On 1/10/2025, MARA announced a 300M dilution which will dilute current shareholders by 60%. Because MARA has 333M shares, this potentially means each MARA share can drop close to 50% within a day whenever this dilution gets processed. Furthermore, plans to grow by 7 EH/s and/or pursue HPC-AI means RIOT may likely seek another $750M ATM at the cost of shareholders.\n\nOkay, okay… so what does this all mean? To figure that out, we have to take a look at some numbers...\n\nCLSK will likely have the highest amount BTC holdings in June 2025 per dollar spent TODAY on CLSK shares REGARDLESS of BTC price at $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k. This is based on figures which add up current BTC holdings and projected mining revenue (Figures 5 to 8) with averaged out monthly growth based on current EH/s goals. The amount held in BTC is then divided by market cap (corrected for dilution and ATM) to give the projected percent BTC holding per market cap as shown by Figure 1.\n\nThis means that buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. The goal in buying BTC miners is to pick a company that acquires BTC cheaper which generates enough profit to outpace the gains one gets buying BTC. Unlike CLSK whose competitive advantage is finding sites at low cost, RIOT and MARA copied MSTR and took out loans via convertible notes to buy spot BTC. This artificially raised their BTC holdings and only leads to further release of ATM’s and/or dilution at the expense of shareholders tomorrow.\n\nOut of good faith to those interested, I investigated this industry and formed my opinions based on the numbers I have observed. For CLSK, TTM price-to-sale (P/S) will likely drop by June 2025 to \\~3.58 (which indicates \\~2x value at current prices). CLSK had 39.1 EH/s with revenue of 668 BTC ($70.2M) in December 2024 which beat average revenue of 514 BTC from May 2024 to November 2024. With CLSK fully funding growth of 11.9 more EH/s (30.4%) by H1 2025, CLSK revenue will increase monthly by \\~5% for a TTM annual revenue of 8,070 BTC ($807M).\n\nThe lower projected 3.58 P/S for CLSK is NOT priced in and does NOT account for holdings which would be \\~13913 BTC ($1.39B) by June 2025 at $100k. If BTC reaches $150k by mid 2025, industry low cost of \\~$64k per coin mined means CLSK makes \\~$694M PROFIT from July 2024 to June 2025. This means CLSK would make $50k MORE PROFIT per coin mined than each coin RIOT and MARA bought at \\~$100k. This is where the REAL value lies with mining stocks. If done efficiently, profits can be made, and shareholders can benefit too.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided above is for general informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

It turns out that the smoke was probably the beginning of the new Kenneth fire. Shortly after we got home, there was a large plume of smoke and then it was clear this was a new fire. The winds were high and most of the fire fighters were working on the big LA fires so it was hard to know how it would evolve. Within about 10 minutes, we got an “evacuation warning” on our cell phones.  In the language of public emergency messages “evacuation warning” means pack up and get ready to leave, while “evacuation order” means get out and go now.\n\n As it turns out, we had a written list of items to pull together for evacuations, so I pulled that out and started working through the list as calmly as I could manage. When I got to the wallet thumb drive, I went to where it was supposed to be and my heart sank: It was not there. Around this time, the sheriff drives by with a bullhorn and I thought he was telling us to evac now. At this point, I am relieved that I have a backup drive with a relative far away, because my wife has a number of medical issues and reduced mobility, so I just don’t have time to figure out why my thumb drive is not where it is supposed to be.  I gather up a few more things and head out to the car and make sure the wife is ready, because for all I know this is the last time we see our house before it joins the many smoldering ruins that we’ve seen on the news. \n\nNow it turns out (thank all the gods) that this was as far into hell as we descended. The actual end of the story went like this: I went outside, and my neighbors were talking to a firefighter. He told us that as long as the winds did not shift, we would likely not have to evacuate, which meant that I had misunderstood what the sheriff driving around with a bullhorn was saying.  (The sheriff was making sure that everyone knew we should prepare to evacuate in case they missed the cell phone message, and the key thing that I misheard is that people *who need a lot of time* should go now.) The fire then grew to about a 1000 acres before it was officially stopped. I will never let a fire fighter buy his own drink from now on. \n\nHowever, just before going outside and learning that we were probably going to be OK, there were about a million thoughts racing through my head about how inadequately I had prepared for the possible endings. Now, I thought I was prepared (I had a list! I had a portable backup drive!) but what was most missing from my emergency planning: For a long-time hodler, life is going to change. Your spouse might develop a serious medical issue, and your parent might start showing signs of dementia. You might need to take care of an injured spouse during evacuation, and you will have precisely zero time to allot to your wallet backup plan, because (trust me on this): What is ultimately important becomes screamingly obvious during such moments, and it turns out that btc is not at the top of your list. \n\nMemorizing passphrases etc is good and all, but you are going to age too. You may suffer an injury in the disaster you are escaping from and you yourself will start experiencing memory loss. So whatever password is only in your head? Definitely rethink that strategy.\n\nThat drive you left with an aging parent? They did not know (or did not remember) that you thought it was important. They are preparing to sell their home and downsize, so it went into the trash. (This was roughly true in my case, as I found out later that week. *That* would have been a bad surprise.)\n\nHow about where you are going to escape to? Cell phone service was essentially dead. There are bars on the phone (the cell towers are active) but within certain cells you cannot get data or a phone call out. I hope that 911 service was still there (I sure as hell wasn’t going to test it without an actual emergency, those guys were full of them already) and that is why the cell service was alive at all. So you will need some type of offline map. You may think you know the roads, but imagine everyone in your area leaving: Do you know the side roads? How far away?  As you probably heard, there were cases were folks needed to walk away from their cars. This happened because those particular roads were funnels with no productive side streets to utilize. [In one report](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/residents-evacuate-and-flee-as-palisades-fire-grows/), LAFD told people to get out of their cars to escape the flames and then the fire depts bulldozed them out of the way, and [in another](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfire-windstorm-01-07-25#cm5n82fuo00003b6m6dg9oc1x) report, folks considered heading to the beach in order to escape the flames. \n\nThere is even the case that you are not allowed into your home: When coming back from the hike, I already smelled the smoke. But a little while later, and our path would have been blocked. Does your backup plan include geodiverse recovery? It very much needs to. \n\nTo give you a sense of the blindness that will occur as you are trying to calmly exit and not panic: My backup USB was just a little further down on the shelf. It is now part of a go-bag that I will keep and review every N months (N=6? I think), so that there is one less item to grab. \n\nSo in summary, there are three cases:\n\n* When you are away and your house evaporates for some reason: Have a geodiverse backup, independent of people if possible.\n* When there is no time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/), btc backup should be in it.\n* When there is time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/) with your btc backup, have a written list of other things to pack. The top of the list should be things you grab first in case you don't have time to grab them all.", "lang": null, "likes": 35, "replies": 26, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i54bls/post_emergency_analysis_psa_what_went_right_and/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I’m set on using a DCA (dollar-cost averaging) methodology, but with a bit of a twist. Instead of buying regularly at fixed intervals, I accumulate Bitcoin over time and occasionally increase my investment when the market dips significantly.\n\nCurrently, I’m using Binance to trade futures contracts and take long positions. My strategy looks something like this:\n\n1. I buy futures long contracts periodically, following a modified DCA approach.\n2. I use low leverage, typically 3x, to manage risk.\n3. When the market experiences a sharp dip, I increase my investment slightly more than usual to take advantage of the opportunity.\n4. When the position reaches a certain percentage of profit (depending on market conditions), I sell and lock in the gains.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nI’m worried about the funding fees that come with futures. I understand that these fees slowly eat into my position’s value over time, which means that if I hold a position for too long, a chunk of the profit goes towards these maintenance costs.\n\nMy Questions for You:\n\n1. Would it make more sense to switch entirely to the spot market, trade Bitcoin there, and avoid the funding fees? I’m not looking to hold BTC long term—I just want to profit from trading. However, with spot trading, I lose the ability to use leverage, which could limit my returns.\n2. Does it make sense to stick with futures contracts and my modified DCA strategy using low leverage (3x)? This approach allows me to grow my position faster and take advantage of leverage, but the funding fees are a concern.\n\nWhat would you recommend for someone who:\n\n* Trades on Binance and is familiar with the platform.\n* Wants to profit from BTC price movements rather than holding it long term.\n* Prefers to use low leverage to minimize risks (3x).\n* Occasionally increases investments during significant market dips to take advantage of lower prices.\n* Is actively monitoring the market and trades regularly.\n\nI’m also curious about your experiences with funding fees and whether anyone has successfully used futures with a low-leverage DCA strategy on Binance.

This may suit older investors who can’t handle large drops since they need the funds for retirement living so are happy to pay for the ‘insurance’ but still get exposure to large upside. There may be ‘mid-level’ and ‘aggressive’ variants to protect against 40% and 60% drops with progressively lower MER. \n\nI’m sure advanced investors, companies and institutions already do this manually but this would be pre-packaged product for the average investor in their IRA/RRSP.

They seem to occur approximately a year after Bitcoin hits ATH for that 4 year cycle.  Here are some notable past retractions.\n\n1. December 2013 : Bitcoin = $1000.\nDecember 2014: Bitcoin = $375.(62% drop)\n\n2.December 2017 : Bitcoin = $17,000.\nDecember 2018 : Bitcoin = $3,200.(80% drop)\n\n3.November 2021 : Bitcoin = $64,000.\nNovember 2022: Bitcoin = $16,000.(75% drop)\n\nSo why does this happen?  And will it happen this current cycle?\n\nThe why:\n\nFor each price retraction, you can potentially argue for unique reasons why they occurred.  For example, in 2022 the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 7 times, from nearly 0 to 4.25-4.50%.\n\nBut in general, I believe the reliable timing of these price retractions (admittedly with only 3 data points) signal that they occur due to pure crowd psychology and the fact that demand side buying pressure is difficult to sustain over long periods of time.  Remember that demand typically increases approx. one year prior to halving and at this point in the cycle, increased demand needs to be sustained for nearly 3 continuous years to keep increasing price.\n\nThe factors at ATH are: \n1. Investors begin taking profits.\n2. People who bought near the top due to FOMO (and have little regard for fundamentals) see this correction due to selling pressure and panic sell, fueling further losses.  \n3.  The news cycle starts to report on the “bubble bursting,” often reporting headlines without proper context (“Bitcoin down 35%!” Without stating the time period it was down 35%)\n4. Many investors of Bitcoin are aware of the 4 year cycle.  And while we collectively prepare for the post halving bull run, as price reaches a hypothetical ATH, it’s every man for himself in terms of exit strategy.  You take profits based on your own unique financial situation.  Demand side pressure slowly decreases, and the price trades sideways for months, followed by slow losses but constant losses each month.\n\nConclusion: So will we see another price retraction this cycle?\n\nAnswer:  Most likely, yes.  But it depends on why you believe they occur.  If you believe, as I do, that price retractions are fundamentally due to 2 things-The difficulty in sustaining increased demand side buy pressure over 3 continuous years and basic crowd psychology-\n\nThen, yes, a huge price retraction is coming one year after BTC hits ATH.  If Bitcoin maxes out at 150k in December 2025, history tells us that December 2026 could reveal a Bitcoin price of $50,000 (65% drop.). \n\nIf you believe that each price retraction was unique in nature, then no, there may not be one this cycle.  \n\nCheers!", "lang": null, "likes": 25, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h24dzb/lets_talk_about_bitcoin_price_retractions_why/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Many people assumed that knowing the multiplier would enable you to calculate a future price by simple multiplication of the net amount of dollars invested. [ I posted a calculation showing that using their multiplier was not so simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194358b/price_estimates_using_the_boa_multiplier/), and the price goes as the square root of the total dollars invested.\n\nSo as we approach $100K/btc, I was curious how things have played out over nearly a year.  I am going to assume that the total dollars locked into bitcoin for the multiplier is equal to the total ETF investment given [here](https://farside.co.uk/btc/) ($30.8B).  Also, I'm going to add in the total MSTR investment as given [here](https://mstr-tracker.com/) ($16.5B), and since I don't have the full MSTR ownership history, we're going to assume it all happened this year, which is an overestimate, but since my total investment is ETF+MSTR only, hopefully the overestimate captures some of the other investment that is being ignored.\n\nWith those (somewhat crappy) assumptions, and using the BoA multiplier value of 135, **the price predicted is $147K per bitcoin**.\n\nOK, that's pretty far off. What could contribute to the error?\n\n1. My overestimate of MSTR ownership happening all in the current year\n2. The multiplier as calculated by BoA is too high\n3. TheRe ARe EvIL mAnIpUlaTORs KEePING ThE PriCE DoWn!!1!\n\nMy best guess is reason 2, so I can turn around the calculation and use a current price of $97K and **solve for the multiplier instead. which turns out to be close to 50 at a price of $47K.**\n\nI found it to be an interesting way of looking at price prediction in any case, and I have to wonder what price discovery is going to look like above $100K because I find it difficult to believe that BoA's multiplier is going continue to make any sense if the price accelerates higher.\n\nEdit: To /u/[FreshMistletoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreshMistletoe/) point below, there's another way to look at it.

By day trading with $150, I've earned about $16 (with fees accounted for) and paid about $20 in trading fees. Whereas if I kept the SATS I bought originally, they'd have gained about $49 in value. Therefore, my ultimate takeaway is that day trading offers a way to keep the money in circulation, possibly the ability to keep money safer from the market drops, but in the end also shields you from potential long term gains as well.\n\nI wanted to perform this analysis to compare potential of day trading to long term investments and out of curiosity. My takeaway is that weekends are generally great for price increases, and generally price will dip before and after the weekend.

I am looking into using leverage for swing trading. I am still new to this and won't consider actually leverage trading before I better understand it, don't worry.\n\nHere's a scenario. I hold 1 BTC and I will use 2x leverage (which is the maximum I am comfortable with for swing trading given its corresponding liquidation price). To simplify I won't include fees in my calculations. I close out the trade after each theoretical price increase and use the profits to buy BTC.\n\nScenario 1: BTC doubles in price, and I will have 1.5 BTC instead of 1 BTC (if I just held my BTC).  \nScenario 2: BTC triples in price, and I will have 1.66 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  \nScenario 3: BTC quadruples in price, and I will have 1.75 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  \nMeanwhile, in fiat terms I will have made 1, 2 or 3 times (in scenarios 1 to 3, respectively) my inital btc investment (in USD) in profits. But I do not want fiat, I want Bitcoin. so for accumulating Bitcoin it is markedly less interesting than for making fiat gains. So it would make sense for me to only use this strategy if I invest the profits in something else than the underlying asset, like the stock market for instance.\n\nI am all-in on crypto and it would be good for me to diversify by investing in the stock market. In this case I think 2x leverage swing trading would be attractive, trying to exit at 2-3x current market price. But it is a lot less attractive reinvesting the profits into the underlying asset, BTC, given the diminishing returns.  \nPlease let me know if my analysis has been sound thus or if I am missing something. I would not be comfortable increasing my liquidation price as the BTC price goes up.\n\n\n\nEdit: the more I think about it, the more answers I think I am getting. Diminishing returns doesn't have to be a problem as long as Bitcoin outpaces, say the stock market, by roughly 2.5x (quick math). Given year on year historical growth records one would predict it will outpace the stock market by a far greater ratio so, actually, investing the leverage trade gains into Bitcoin will still be better than investing it into an asset like stocks.\n\nEdit 2 months later, probably no one will read this but just in case: do your due diligence. There was a lot I didn't know about and still don't. I haven't used leverage and discovered more drawbacks such as rebalancing. Leverage is for short term and people who know what they are doing.

The bull market starts about Sep 2015 and the ATH follows about 850 days later at the 2.214 retracement.\n\nIn the 2017 to 2021 cycle the final bear market capitulation was Nov 2018 (it dropped a bit further but Nov was the killer month), and the 0.786 was broken in Oct 2020 which is 700 days later (it was touched in Jun 2019 but pulled back). The bull market starts about Apr 2019 (the April Fool's day candle) and the ATH follows about 914 days later (so a bit longer).\n\n**But**, the top is lower, what happened? Covid19 happened. After the price crash in Mar 2020, price recovered, then the money printers started as governments round the world tried to fix the total cluster f\\*\\*k which were the pandemic lockdowns. The result was a whole lot of people ended up with surplus fiat - think the laptop classes with stimulus cheques or furlough payments, with much less opportunity to spend, and so on. So, pay off some debt, save some fiat, invest .... and take a punt on crypto, it's free money after all. When the bull market really took hold, a lot of retail was already way in profit, so much less FOMO.\n\nSo, what should the top have been? Well, it should have been over 200K: the 2.272 retracement is at 210K give-to-take.\n\nNow, lets look at the current cycle. The capitulation event is Jun 2022 (Terra/Luna collapse - the FTX crash is not the same), so the 0.786 retracement break should not have been until May 2024 - but it has happened, in Feb 2024.\n\nWell, rather than say \"this time is different on account of the ETFs\", which means two \"different\" events (Covid19 and the ETFs) lets apply Occam's Razor, and assume only one \"different\" event, namely the one that has already happened, Covid19. In that case, we adjust the 2021 to 2025 cycle retracement to set the top at 216K which would be the 2.272 retracement \"top\" on the prior cycle plus a bit. This looks about right, the 0.786 retracement is now at about 115K which looks plausible given the current momentum.\n\nIn that case, the next ATH will be around Jul 2015 (912 days from the capitulation) and at around 940K (the 2.272 retracement).\n\nSo, there you have it.

On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: “bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.” and “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto”.\n\nIn this post I want to focus on the SEC’s warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‘risky’. I couldn’t find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.\n\nAs a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of bitcoin vs tech stocks:\n\n1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever\n\n1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash\n\n1. The largest market cap loss\n\n1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently\n\nThis is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.\n\n**1. Worst Investment Possible: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zvbxSYz.png\n\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Price | End Price | $100 bought at top and sold at bottom was worth | ROI %\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | Nov-2008 | $35.35 | $12.37 | $35 | -65% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | Feb-2009 | $59.97 | $16.10 | $27 | -73% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $414.50 | $108.24 | $26 | -74% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | Oct-2022 | $382.76 | $92.60 | $24 | -76% |\n| Netflix | May-2011 | Aug-2012 | $39.00 | $8.00 | $21 | -79% |\n| Apple | Mar-2000 | Apr-2003 | $1.34 | $0.23 | $17 | -83% |\n| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | Sep-2002 | $5.58 | $0.70 | $13 | -87% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |\n| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | Nov-2011 | $26.48 | $2.33 | $9 | -91% |\n| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | Dec-2018 | $1,292.63 | $84.47 | $7 | -93% |\n| Amazon | Apr-1999 | Sep-2001 | $5.53 | $0.28 | $5 | -95% |\n| AMD | Jan-2006 | Sep-2015 | $42.01 | $1.65 | $4 | -96% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |\n\nThe worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‘least worst’ investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.\n\nIt is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin’s market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.\n\n\n**2. Worst Recent Investments: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Price | End Price | $100 bought at top and sold at bottom was worth | ROI %\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Apple | Dec-2021 | Dec-2022 | $182.13 | $125.87 | $69 | -31% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | Oct-2022 | $344.30 | $219.13 | $64 | -36% |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | Dec-2022 | $149.12 | $86.37 | $58 | -42% |\n| Amazon | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $188.11 | $81.69 | $43 | -57% |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | Sep-2022 | $346.47 | $119.46 | $34 | -66% |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $164.46 | $54.57 | $33 | -67% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $414.50 | $108.24 | $26 | -74% |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $64,158.12 | $15,883.16 | $25 | -75% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | Oct-2022 | $382.76 | $92.60 | $24 | -76% |\n| Netflix | Oct-2021 | Jun-2022 | $690.97 | $164.28 | $24 | -76% |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | Jul-2022 | $4,733.36 | $1,036.19 | $22 | -78% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |\n\nInstead of using data from an asset’s entire history, this table compares the worst investments possible during the most recent market crash. All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet. Bitcoin was the sixth worst asset and Ethereum was the third. This tells the same narrative that crypto investments can produce bad returns, but not necessarily much different from tech stocks.\n\n**3. Market Cap Loss: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gZ0bHUf.png\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Market Cap | End Market Cap | Value Destroyed\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Peloton | Jan-2021 | Feb-2024 | $48,341,000,000 | $1,665,600,000 | -$46,675,400,000 |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $195,524,200,000 | $90,305,100,000 | -$105,219,100,000 |\n| Zoom | Oct-2020 | Feb-2024 | $161,647,800,000 | $18,910,800,000 | -$142,737,000,000 |\n| Netflix | Jan-2022 | Nov-2022 | $729,473,500,000 | $313,861,300,000 | -$415,612,200,000 |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | Jul-2022 | $559,910,000,000 | $126,170,000,000 | -$433,740,000,000 |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $835,067,500,000 | $279,552,300,000 | -$555,515,200,000 |\n| Meta | Sep-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,077,535,300,000 | $235,749,200,000 | -$841,786,100,000 |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Jan-2023 | $1,235,155,400,000 | $341,353,000,000 | -$893,802,400,000 |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,210,000,000,000 | $305,020,000,000 | -$904,980,000,000 |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,997,397,915,765 | $1,076,770,529,999 | -$920,627,385,766 |\n| Microsoft | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $2,576,063,200,000 | $1,597,120,900,000 | -$978,942,300,000 |\n| Apple | Jan-2022 | Jan-2023 | $2,986,128,300,000 | $1,989,628,300,000 | -$996,500,000,000 |\n| Amazon | Jul-2021 | Dec-2022 | $1,875,751,400,000 | $847,145,400,000 | -$1,028,606,000,000 |\n\nTo avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.\n\nBy none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.\n\n**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** \n\nAll-time worst market crash comparison:\n\nAsset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |\n| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |\n| Apple | Mar-2000 | 1126 | -0.07% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |\n| Amazon | Apr-1999 | 884 | -0.11% |\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | 397 | -0.16% |\n| Netflix | May-2011 | 458 | -0.17% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |\n| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | 334 | -0.28% |\n| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |\n| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |\n\nBitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren’t making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin’s ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)\n\nMost recent market crash comparison:\n\nAsset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |\n| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |\n| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |\n| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |\n\nIn the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOut of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png\n\nLooking back at the SEC’s statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin’s volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC’s statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. \n\n**A Sidenote on Beta**\n\nBeta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‘the broader market’. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&amp;P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&amp;P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&amp;P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&amp;P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.\n\nAsset | Beta | Interpretation |\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Ethereum | 0.08 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |\n| Bitcoin | 0.20 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |\n| Microsoft | 0.95 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | 1.05 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Apple | 1.06 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Amazon | 1.12 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Netflix | 1.15 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Meta | 1.34 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Zoom | 1.36 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| AMD | 1.48 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Nvidia | 1.78 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Tesla | 1.95 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Peloton | 2.84 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |", "lang": null, "likes": 61, "replies": 27, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bd6k5n/bitcoin_vs_tech_stocks_is_bitcoin_really_as_risky/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

The bitcoin top has been breached at 67.8k, and if another big day it’ll be 68.9kish by Wednesday which will mark the absolute top.

Every indicator is screening this is the biggest bull trap possibly ever. Yes I get ETF’s are out and “this time is different” but remember as fast as retail and institutions buy they can sell. It is different per se in testing ATH before the halving, but the real bull market begins later this year. \n\nOnce the FED begins to cut rates this summer the market will drop and experience heavy volatility.

I’ve been researching bitcoin and this bitcoin halving cycle and came to some conclusions. \n\nCan someone play devils advocate or let me know if I’m wrong on any of these points? I know that there some veterans in this subreddit, and I’m hoping to get some other viewpoints to challenge my thesis: \n\n\n1. Nobody has ever lost money holding bitcoin for any rolling 4 year period \n\n2. In the last phase of each bull market cycle, bitcoin will have parabolic moves up, and then crashes hard, but never significantly goes below the all time high price of the last bull market cycle. For example, bitcoin reached an all time high of 65-70K in 2021, and then crashed 70-80% to around 16K in 2022 only for only a few weeks, but never stayed below the 20K all time high from 2017 for long. The 20K all time high from 2017 was basically the floor for the next cycle \n\nIf the 2021 high for bitcoin was 65-70K then that will be the floor for this bitcoin cycle. Bitcoin will have parabolic moves after this bitcoin halving event in April 2024, but after it inevitably reaches the next all time high and crashes it will not significantly fall under 65K. \nAnyone buying bitcoin at today’s prices will not lose money in the next Bear market and there’s still a large margin of safety \n\n3. What sets this bitcoin cycle apart from any other previous cycle is that SEC approved, regulated bitcoin spot ETFs exist now. Every previous cycle consisted of only retail investors, but now institutional investors have a regulated way to buy bitcoin. The institutional money should make bitcoin less volatile. \n\nAs bitcoin reaches higher and higher market caps we would also expect the price to be less volatile just like any maturing asset. \n\nThis bitcoin cycle or some future bitcoin cycle, people are going to expect bitcoin to eventually crash 70-80%, but bitcoin may only crash 20-40% due to institutional money and increasing adoption/awareness. When bitcoin only crashes 20-40% in the upcoming Bear markets then this will cause many traders to stumble, and will be validation for the bitcoin thesis as a mature asset \n\nAm I wrong on any of the three points above?

And, despite the initial drop we saw last week, I think that is what we're seeing. Are ETFs partially responsible for this? Yes. But what is the mechanism that's taking money from traders? I'm not so sure about this one, but I'm wondering about how Jane Street and other authorized participants (AP) are involved. \n\n## Jane Street's Influence\nThese ETFs aren't just numbers on a screen. They're being nudged and wiggled by the likes of Jane Street, the puppet masters of the ETF world. Recall that Sam Bankmanfried left Jane Street to create FTX, and recruited from Jane Street (including his \"CEO/GF\" of Alameda Research)\n\nhttps://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/\n\nJane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for multiple ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. In the context of Bitcoin ETFs, an authorized participant (AP) like Jane Street has several key responsibilities:\n\n#### Creation and Redemption of ETF Shares\nJane Street manages the process of creating and redeeming ETF shares. This involves handling the inflow and outflow of funds from the ETF, which is critical for maintaining the liquidity and stability of the ETF.\n\n#### Overseeing Cash Transfers\nAs an AP, Jane Street oversees the transfer of cash to and from the ETF's administrator. This is a vital function for ensuring that the ETF operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n#### Market Liquidity Maintenance\nA significant part of an AP's role is to contribute to the liquidity of the ETF in the market. They do this by ensuring that the ETF shares are available for trading and by facilitating the process of share creation and redemption. As a result, Jane Street helps ETFs maintain a market price that is close to the net asset value.\n\n#### Interaction with Market Makers\nJane Street may interact with market makers to ensure that the ETF shares are traded at prices that are close to \"their actual value,\" further contributing to setting the market price.\n\n#### Fulfilling Investor Orders\nJane Street may create or redeem ETF shares in large blocks, known as creation units, which are then exchanged with the ETF for baskets of underlying assets or the equivalent value in cash.\n\nJane Street's expertise and experience in trading and market-making, especially in the ETF domain, make them a key player in the operational mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs. Their role is integral to the smooth functioning of these ETFs, ensuring that they reflect the price movements of Bitcoin while offering a regulated, stock-exchange-listed investment vehicle for Bitcoin exposure.\n\n#### Does Jane Street control both sides of the trade?\nIf you look into Jane Street, you know that their focus is on gaming the market to extract maximum value for themselves and they're making a huge amount of money somewhere. If being an AP for ETFs were not providing an ungodly amount of profit, they would not be involved. Also, remember that Jane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for *multiple* ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. READ, the buy side and sell side are the same entity, **regardless of which ETF you are buying with**.\n\n\n## The Bigger Picture: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe ETFs' story is a starting gun for a new era in crypto, turning Bitcoin into a blue-chip investment. We're talking about a potential influx of $50 billion or more this year alone. almost 100,000 bitcoin have been taken off the market already. And with Bitcoin's market cap hovering over $913 billion, these ETFs will add extreme bullish pressure to the price in the last two quarters of this year.\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis isn't just about numbers and charts (and assholes). It's about a seismic shift in the crypto universe. The ETFs are reshaping how we think about Bitcoin and its kin. Are we creating a new mental model about a market that's maturing, evolving--unpredictable as ever (but also, maybe, a little more stable)?\n\n## What's next?\n\nOnly time will tell, but one thing's for sure: the crypto market will never be controlled by unprofessional hacks, slinging private keys around on a web server, again.\n\nGood hunting.\n\nhttps://www.moonmath.win/", "lang": null, "likes": 41, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/19bh3v3/major_moon_math_update_jane_street_and_the_great/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

This is my primer on the potential Bitcoin ETF approval, found in my newsletter.\n\nOn Wednesday the SEC is widely expected to accept a number of Bitcoin ETF’s - which would allow stock mark funds to directly access the Digital Gold without having to deal with crypto exchanges. In the run up to this deadline, BTC has seen some volatile action, spiking in either direction amid conflicting reports; (a) On Wednesday 3rd January, Matrixport projected that the SEC would reject all applications - and cautioned traders to hedge long exposure. (b) On Friday 5th January, Bloomberg reported that applicants had cleared a key hurdle and is on path for SEC approval. (c) At pixel time, market sentiment is pointing towards an approval for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n**SCENARIOS:**\n\nThere are a number of different scenarios that could potentially occur. (1) All 11 applicants receive approval - a “fee war” may ensue, with funds looking to gain market share. (2) All 11 applicants get rejected - previous rejections have occurred on the basis that Crypto is vulnerable to fraud. (3) Some applicants receive approval, whilst others are rejected - some may not have met guidelines.Note: Scenario summary from WSJ piece found here.\n\n**Sell the news event?**\n\nWith BTC having gained over 50% in the past 6 months (+6%) this past month, many have suggested that the ETF news has been priced in by the markets already - with some analysts pointing towards this being a “sell the news” event. On the other hand, experts have pointed towards favourable technicals alongside strong momentum to support a bullish move post-approval.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My opinion?** In terms of the scenarios listed above; (2) would no doubt, be disastrous for Crypto, and would be indicative of a continued lack of confidence in the space. (1) expect volatility to occur in either direction - may well jump on approval and proceed to a marked sell-off, the opposite is also possible. I think the former will occur. (3) offers long-term catalysts for traders - some may see it as “more work to do / more approvals to be optimistic about”.\n\n**PIXEL TIME**\n\nFfs! As I wind down for the day with a scroll on Twitter, I find that the SEC X/Twitter account was hacked and subsequently made an announcement that Bitcoin ETF’s were approved. To make clear, this is false, no approval has been made yet. For reference, large Twitter accounts have been running with “ETF rejected” - which is not the case.In an immediate reaction to the initial tweet (which was assumed as fact) Bitcoin jumped from $46.7k to $47.8k; before then paring the entire move dipping to lows of $44.9k after the SEC announced it was hacked.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "18li2oy", "author": "blatchcorn", "handle": "blatchcorn", "created_utc": 1702929864.0, "text": "Here is my thesis why Bitcoin is undervalued relative to gold Cast your mind back to mid-October. The price of Bitcoin was $27K, bulls were waiting for confirmation of a spot ETF, and bears were waiting for one last capitulation. Since then the price has increased +55% to $42K at the time of writing; the price briefly hit $44k in early December. The price rally was driven by rumours that the SEC will confirm the spot ETF - they actually delayed the decision to Q1 24 - and speculation that the FED will reduce interest rates. Regardless of whether you are a bull or a bear, everyone trading or investing in Bitcoin wants to know: what is Bitcoin really worth?\n\nOne way to estimate the true value of Bitcoin is to benchmark it against something else. Bitcoin is commonly compared to Gold. This post will estimate the true value of Bitcoin by using Gold as a benchmark. Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, has completed the first step of benchmarking Bitcoin vs Gold by comparing the fundamentals. See [this link](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/bitcoin-first.pdf) and comparison chart below. The conclusion is that as a store of value, Bitcoin is better or equal to gold in six out of seven characteristics. Gold beats bitcoin for a longer track record. Overall I agree with their assessment. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WN1aASj.png\n\nTo estimate the true value of Bitcoin, we need to build upon Fidelity’s work. One weakness of this comparison chart is that some categories are more important than others. I have assigned an importance to each category below. This is subjective. Someone could make it more objective, but it would make the analysis more painstaking to complete and I don’t think my importance ratings will be majorly controversial anyway. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/n2M1WZV.png\n\nThe largest consequence of my importance ratings is that Gold is going to get a favourable comparison vs Bitcoin for winning the ‘track record’ category which has 65% importance. I think that is cautiously fair. The largest advantage of Gold is that it has been used as a store of value for over 2,500 years and I think track record is an important characteristic for most investors. Crypto investors evidently don’t care about track record, but outside of crypto a lot of investors do care. I have avoided making any dubious assumptions that benefit Bitcoin in this benchmarking analysis. I would prefer to make a confident estimate that ‘Bitcoin is worth at least X’ instead of a dubious claim that ‘Maybe Bitcoin could be worth up to X’. For example, I think I have been harsh on Bitcoin to say that ‘verifiable’ only has a 14% importance. This is an important characteristic and Bitcoin is much more verifiable than Gold. So my end calculation will under-value Bitcoin if you agree verifiable is actually more important than 14%.\n\nNext I want to quantify the exact difference between Bitcoin and Gold given Fidelity’s ratings and my importance ratings. The first step is to assign arbitrary points for each category. The winner of a category gets 100 points, the loser gets zero points, and for a draw both Bitcoin and gold get 50 points each. Here is how the results look:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UOa7Vu0.png\n\n\nBitcoin investors might be shouting ‘Stop the count!’ at this point because Bitcoin looks like a better store of value than Gold. But we have not considered the importance of each category just yet. Gold is going to perform much better once we factor in the importance of ‘track record’. To consider category importance, I calculated a weighted score by multiplying the points by importance. The results are shown below.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vcZrqfA.png\n\nBitcoin scores 26 vs gold 74 after we consider the importance of each category. This result is more meaningful if you put it into a percentage: Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold as a store of value (26/74 = 35%). This 35% is a key figure that will be used to value Bitcoin in the remainder of this post. If you disagree with 35% that’s fine, you can replicate the steps below with a different figure. For example, if you think Bitcoin is half as good as Gold, you can use 50%. To estimate the value of one bitcoin we need to gather the remaining inputs for our calculation: (Market cap of Gold * % used for investing *  35%) / supply of bitcoin.\n\nAccording to [Infinite Market Cap](https://8marketcap.com/), the market cap of Gold is $13.7 trillion. The small print mentions that the market cap is the total value mined. What we are interested in is the market cap of Gold used for investing because that is the market Bitcoin is trying to capture. Bitcoin can’t be used for jewellery. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Monetary_use): “The world's consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewellery, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry”. The exact percentages are debated because Gold reserves are not regularly audited (if at all). A few [other sources](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/gold-market-primer-market-size-and-structure) tend to gravitate around a 40% figure. So we will stick with 40%. Lastly there is a maximum of 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. Not all Bitcoin has been mined yet, and some has been lost. But I will use 21 million to err on the side of a pessimistic estimate.\n\nPut this all together and you can estimate the value of one bitcoin as ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.\n\nI like this analysis for three reasons. (1) It is based on the value of Gold which is a moving target and Bitcoin has a real opportunity to capture some of this market. (2) The assumptions are pretty ‘safe’. I think the biggest underlying assumption is the belief that if Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold it should also be worth 35% of the addressable market. (3) It passes the ‘eyeball test’. The logic makes sense and the end result is a believable number.\n\nIf someone wanted to, they could also repeat this process for other markets that Bitcoin could capture. For example Bitcoin might partly capture market share of the reserve currency market cap or the real estate investment market cap. Then you could add the Gold benchmark + reserve currency benchmark + real estate market benchmark to have a final number.\n\nFor now, I am content believing that one bitcoin is worth $92K which could deliver a 119% ROI for anyone buying at the current market price.\n\nBtw, if anyone wants a minimalist website to track the price of bitcoin over the next bull market cycle, I made [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com/)\n\nTLDR:\n\nValuation calculation vs gold =\n(market cap of gold * percentage used for investing * percentage of market bitcoin should capture) / supply of bitcoin\n\n= ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 7, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18li2oy/here_is_my_thesis_why_bitcoin_is_undervalued/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

One could pick a different month or number of months before the halving date, or the low since the last halving.\nAlso, this doesn’t take into account other functions that Bitcoin may fulfill in time. Standard of money. Increasing use as a currency. Endless possibilities. These could and likely would increase bitcoin’s value further. \nIn the year after the first halving in July 2012, price went from around $2.32 in December 2011 to $190 in April 2013. 82x. 10.5M btc were mined 50%\nAfter the second halving price went from $396 in December 2015 to $19720 in December of 2017, 49x. 15.75M btc had been mined. 75% \n3rd, $7200 December 2019-$68,000 in November 2021. 9x 18.375M bitcoin mined. 87.5%\nAs we approach the next halving in April 2024, we are around $44,000. 93.75% of Bitcoin will have been mined. \nAs you can see, after each halving the price goes up, but less so after each subsequent event. \nPlotting each ATH against the % mined is only meaningful on a logarithmic scale. If X axis is % mined and Y axis is price in log, one sees a rather straight line up and to the right. \nThis is where I am out of my water. I’m searching on excel to find a formula that would express the relation of the ATH log-10 versus the % of Bitcoin mined. Eyeballing a rough log-10 graph, it appears to be in the range of $200,000. \nThe other item O noticed when plotting these numbers is that the movement along the X or % mined axis are getting closer and closer together. So even though the ATH increases logarithmically, the increasingly smaller movement along the C axis limits the corresponding result on the Y axis. \nAs we know, this halving will progress until the last whole bitcoin is mined. \nFor the mathematical experts in the sub please take this from here.  \nThanks.", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18f56l0/does_anyone_know_how_to_plot_numbers_on_a_log10/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

All the plots are at:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Ybq4Z69](https://imgur.com/a/Ybq4Z69)\n\nPart 1:  BTC 4-Year Price Ratios\n\nI have BTC price data going back to Aug 2011, so I have 4-Y price ratios from Aug 2015.  Chart 1 shows BTC price, the 4-year price ratio, and the 1-year median of the 4-Y ratio.  For a little over 4 years (mid 2017 to late 2021) the 4-year ratio varied between 10x and 50x.  When the blow-off top never materialized after the 2020 halving, the 4-year ratio fell into a new, lower range.  Chart 2 shows the same data, but with the ratio plotted on a linear scale instead of log.\n\nChart 3 is a close-up of this new range (2.5x - 7x).  This new range is just under 2 years old.  The previous range held for 4 years, what if this range holds for another 2?  That leads us to Chart 4.\n\nChart 4 BTC plots 2.5x (green) and 7x (red) the price 4 years earlier against the current price. Looking out 2 years, it suggests  a BTC price between $80K and $200K.\n\nPart 2: 50-D /200-D SMA Crosses\n\nChart 5 shows BTC price (black), the 50-D SMA (orange), and the 200-D SMA (red).  In addition, I've plotted the non-dimensional 50/200 gap (\\[50D - 200D\\]/200D) in blue.  Ratio peaks corresponding to cycle tops are marked with black stars (I'm treating the first of the two peaks in 2021 as the top for this analysis).\n\nAfter the late 2013 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It briefly broke positive twice (1 &amp; 2) , then broke positive and stayed positive all the way through to the 2017 peak (3).\n\nAfter the late 2017 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It first broke positive for a longer time than the previous cycle  (1) , then again for a very short time (2) similar to the previous cycle.  It then broke positive and stayed positive all the way through to the 2021 peak (3).\n\nAfter the late 2021 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It broke positive for a period between the prior cycles  (1) , then again for a longer period (2).  A few days ago, it broke positive for the third time since the last cycle top (3).\n\nAlso of interest is the bottoming of the gap below -0.3, marked with orange.  This has happened three times.  The first two times were excellent entry points.\n\nUPDATE\n\nTGI Chartday!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TdLHef5](https://imgur.com/a/TdLHef5)\n\nHow much not-going-upness could we see before we should be worried?  \n\nChart 1 is BTC price after cycle tops, normalized to Nov 2021 prices.  The price has conformed to the ranges of the past two cycles fairly well so far.  The price could be flat for the next 10 months and still be echoing the past.\n\nChart 2 is BTC price, the 13-W (91-D) SMA, and the ratio of the price to the 13-W.  In sustained, non-parabolic moves up, the ratio tends to go between 1.0 and 1.3 (highlighted).  In parabolic moves, the ratio stays above 1.3, sometimes going as high at 1.8+.  The ratio is currently 1.244.  The 13-W is $28.1K and climbing about $55/day.  \n\nChart 3 shows BTC price and its 4-Y SMA, as well as the block reward and its 4-Y SMA. BTC is currently further above its 4-Y than any time in more than a year, which is also the case with the block reward.  BTC's 4-Y SMA is currently $27.6K.\n\nWhat do I do with all of this?  I put in a set-and-forget buy a little above $29K, and another a little above $30K.

Here are some of the lessons/observations I learned:\n\n1. Bitcoin/crypto (to me it was just bitcoin) was the wild west of trading and that comes with a ton of risk and opportunity. The risk is you have your money in the wrong spot, it can disappear without any wrongdoing on your part--counterparty risk. I had my money on MtGox briefly but thankfully I moved it to Bitfinex b/c BFX had leverage. Back then BFX was a nascent exchange ran by one French guy in his basement and it had a lot of glitches--for example btc would trade at $80 and I could get executed at $20 with some crafty order placement. Didn't happen often but I made a few thousand risk-free just with these print through executions.  Nowadays bitcoin isn't nearly as thin or volatile and exchanges aren't glitchy -- I  don't/can't trade it the same way because I don't have the same edges.\n2. I thought most \"btc investors\" were just dreamers/cultists back then. This gave me the mental flexibility to trade bitcoin without getting too attached. Little did I know, the \"dream\" would become very, very real with bitcoin going over $10,000 in 2017 and over 50,000 in 2020. While my returns as a trader are pretty solid, they don't come close to the returns of someone who simply held bitcoin at the time I first started trading it with serious risk at $250. That's ok though, I have no regrets. And I've actually become a believer myself, holding a few coins as a buy/hold investor.\n3. I come from a very active trading background. I day trade stocks on a short timeframe, back then even a micro timeframe where I'd hold for 10-20 minutes max on my scalps. I tried to apply this strategy to bitcoin by scalping very harsh dips and selling into the rallies and it worked but it was extremely stressful. The scalping setup equivalent of bitcoin might take an entire day to play out and that's an entire day of monitoring the market depth and price. I'd often take my laptop everywhere and set alarms at night, which at the time there was only one--a site called bitcoinity where it played the Darth Vader NOOOOOOOOOOOO soundbite from Revenge of the Sith. That shit was a nightmare.\n\nAnyway, I've been writing about my adventures in trading and just wrote about my 2013 experience trading bitcoin in this post: [https://churningandburning.com/2023/10/bitcoin-ii-the-no-awakens.html](https://churningandburning.com/2023/10/bitcoin-ii-the-no-awakens.html) \\--  I met an executive at BitInstant (almost got to invest with Charlie Shrem before he got arrested!) via another friend on my desk and we both traded 400 bitcoins in October 2013. We ended up outperforming buy/hold on bitcoin (for that given timeframe) by 4x magnitude through a combination of active trading (scalping 20-25% dips using leverage) and lending out USD on bitfinex. Needless to say I lost a lot of sleep.\n\nHoping for another bull market soon!\n\n(here's my first post on bitcoin, trading it from the $50 to $250 move in early 2013, if anyone wants to read it: https://churningandburning.com/2023/08/bitcoin.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "lang": null, "likes": 31, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/17feaxh/bitcoin_10_years_ago_crossing_the_1000_mark/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

At current price, the amount of new money flowing in to keep price at equilibrium is roughly $24 million per day to offset the newly created supply.\n\nAsset managers for spot ETF applications submitted currently have around $17 trillion in assets under management. Suppose just 1% of that allocation flows into BTC upon approval, that would be $170 billion. Now suppose that $170 billion comes in gradually over the course of 4 years to reach just that 1% allocation. That would equate to an average of $116 million in new money pouring in every single day. That’s nearly 5x as much as the amount needed to keep current price at equilibrium at current block reward. Once the halving occurs next year, it’s nearly 10x as much as the amount needed to keep current price at equilibrium. This is just assuming a 1% allocation from these fund managers reached over the course of 4 years.\n\nWith odds of a spot ETF approval being higher than ever in light of recent developments, there’s a very real possibility that we will get a spot ETF approved at least 3 months before BTC’s halving in April where new supply issuance schedule will drop to 450 newly mined BTC per day. So, with potential for an enormous wave of previously sidelined demand hitting the market you should really take this into consideration if you haven’t already: what happens if BTC reaches a new ATH BEFORE the halving for the first time ever?\n\nPredictable 4 year cycles effectively go out the window if/when that happens at least for a halving or two. Spot ETF approval potentially marks the beginning of the vertical part of S curve adoption as fund managers spend the next several years trying to get to their target portfolio allocation, whatever that percentage amount ends up being. Additionally, [futures are pricing in rate cuts from the Fed to begin by middle of next year.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)\n\nWe basically have a perfect storm trifecta of demand shock, supply shock, and favorable monetary policy scheduled to arrive within a short window of time of one another. I sincerely hope everyone here is using this time wisely as it becomes increasingly likely that we won’t be able to buy at these price levels for much longer and once we finally leave this range of $24.7-$31.8k that we’ve been stuck in for 7 months now, we’re never seeing these prices ever again.", "lang": null, "likes": 131, "replies": 116, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/178fqve/mathematical_implications_of_spot_etf_approval/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Everybody knows what Bitcoin is. Moreover, almost everyone is familiar with its background, that’s why I am not going to share any info about the pizzas, blockchain, crypto exchanges and other stuff that everybody has probably already heard about or can google it in a few seconds.\n\nI’ve been surfing the Internet for interesting crypto articles and found one that seems to be pretty provocative considering the religion and crypto mixed together in it. In this post I will briefly talk about the points.\n\nNowadays cryptocurrency and blockchain are the most popular matter of discussion in the world. If you are a regular to different crypto forums and media resources, you could eventually notice that Bitcoin has gathered a whole crowd of enthusiasts, or to be more precise, adepts, thinking it can be a real religion.\n\n* **Lorcan Roche Kelly** from Bloomberg, a financial news provider, has said that BTC is “the first true religion of the 21st century.”. Also, **Hass McCook** called himself a Bitcoin Evangelist and “The Friar”. He has also written a few Medium posts comparing crypto to religion.\n* The **Church of Bitcoin** was created in 2017. Its followers consider Satoshi Nakamoto to be their prophet.\n* In Texas, there is an advertising campaign with huge billboards saying **“In crypto we trust”, “Crypto is real”** etc.\n\n**What does BTC have in common with religion?**\n\nI can’t really define what religion is because it’s something that has no official scientific meaning explained in the dictionary. All in all, religion is a summary of cultural ideas and doctrines which are related to life, death, and God interpretations. Usually, these depend on the origin countries.\n\nConsidering this, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency do not contain any of these topics which leads us to a logical conclusion — neither Bitcoin nor any other crypto are not connected to religion by no means.\n\n**So why would people claim that BTC is a whole separate religion?**\n\nSome, like Hass McCook, are using the religion terminology to emphasize some Bitcoin cultural aspects and make middlemen get used to them.\n\nFor instance, “stacking sats” (that’s when users purchase small pieces of Bitcoins) sounds strange. But McCook talks about the religious ritual while giving this process another name — “tithing”, used to call the little donations from members in order to support their church.\n\nSo, in this situation, the word actually makes the action sound good and principled.\n\nAdditionally, some Bitcoiners think that BTC is not only the way to make money but also the ultimate answer to all people’s problems. “Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.” Such an attitude might be the reason for comparing BTC with religion.\n\n**In view of the foregoing, do you think cryptocurrency is related to a religious theme, and could Bitcoin become a new religion that solves all of humanity’s problems? If yes, why? Or why not?**", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 25, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/vtc09a/in_crypto_we_trust_or_is_bitcoin_a_religion/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Just adding some opinions to the discourse. Read at your own risk.\n\n\nThe volume we've seen drive down the BTC price is largely institutional traders treating BTC as a speculative asset to make a quick buck in a low interest environment. They quickly dumped their coins in an escape to fiat. The consequence of this dump scared new retailers into selling their coins.\n\nHowever, I imagine the institutions are surprised BTC's price hasn't fallen further. The legion of long term holders that never sell and continue to accumulate is at an all time high. This army of plebs is supporting the price and is unlikely to capitulate under any circumstance (almost).\n\nWhat we're all waiting for is the next leg down after a big dump by whales. This could be the final catalyst before finding the floor. I'm not well versed to the impact from leveraged long and short traders but I've read longs are piling in at record levels. The cascading effect of these liquidations may also be a force to drive price down.\n\nGive it a few months and I believe we'll reach the absolute bottom. My prediction is we'll see $19-22k. This will be the load zone for whales and wall street to re-enter. It may also be the point that some diamond hands show they are not quite strong as presumed. I hope not but the fear it's going to $6k will shake some. Don't fall into this category! Don't be the sell side of the whale buying!\n\nSimultaneous to this price movement, we have layer 2 applications being rapidly developed by top tier teams and individuals. Additionally, we have regulations and revised accounting standards close to being deployed. The stage will be perfectly set for new explosive growth and price movement. By the end of 2022, the price will have recovered to $45k.\n\nWith the stage set and the macro economy stabilizing, a new tidal wave of money will enter the space. This wave will crash everyone's expectations and usher in the next era of BTC. We will quickly see the price rise above $100k by the end of 2023. This momentum's effect on price will strengthen with the aide of the next halving. We will never see another 70% drawdown on BTC's price. We'll reach the $100k+ level and start to stabilize - waiting for the next era that will be even more exciting. I think we'll eventually see $180k in this period.\n\nAnyone that buys now at $30k, will 3-6X their investment by 2024. Anyone that buys at $18-22k will 6-9X their investment. Anyone that ultimately capitulates at $19k, will buy back at $45k.\n\nGood luck ya'll and keep at it!", "lang": null, "likes": 12, "replies": 39, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/uubb1h/my_observations_and_price_predictions/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

However, this has me wondering, what about the average Joe?\n\nThe retail investors that have an actual interest in cryptocurrencies, those that believe in the technology and want to utilize it for its intended purpose; i.e. BTC as a decentralized store of value and payment currency, don't have millions to purchase BTC like institutions.\n\nAs institutions hold billions in BTC, it keeps the buying pressure up, but what if they sell and it causes a large dip in BTC? Institutions can manipulate the market however they want, causing retail to panic sell and then buy back BTC at a lower price. And as BTC falls, other projects that have good fundamentals like Plastiks or Link, they will fall too. And these institutions also include CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, FTX, etc that can see your orders.\n\nTheoretically, a billionaire corporation can buy billions worth of BTC, driving the price up and leaving less supply for the entire world.\n\nIn short, institutional interest in crypto is a part of mass adoption, but it will almost certainly negatively impact the average investor that's in cryptos for the technology.", "lang": null, "likes": 37, "replies": 56, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/u5gy8k/institutions_are_buying_in_huge_amounts_wondering/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I figured I would do an update on my ongoing crypto audit.  **This is long.**\n\nThis applies ONLY to the US.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is MY Experience.  No doubt there are others who know better.  This is advice from someone who really fucked up and is paying dearly for that.  Don't be ME.  Crypto was new in 2017.  I did a lot of poorly though out and kind of \"reckless beyond sense\" things with bitcoin, Etherium, ICOs and every other shitcoin available at the time.\n\n**The TL/DR is, you better have ALL of your details.  Going back to your first trade.  You are NOT smarter than the IRS.**\n\n\\-------------------\n\n Some quick background: \n\nThis audit is on my 2017 taxes.  I received a request for back-up information that was due on August 26th 2019.  I went through my records and reconstructed everything I could find.  I knew i was missing some...but I did not think it would matter.  Silly me.\n\nOf course I waited until the last minute to do the work.  I had a couple other things on my mind.\n\nIt just so happened that August 26 was the day of my wife's Whipple Surgery for pancreatic cancer and it was the day my mom died after being in hospice for 3 weeks.  Literally, the worst day of my life.\n\nNeedless to say, I \"effed\" up the reply and that triggered a real anal probe of a review.  My review indicated I should get a 5 figure refund.  And they paid it. \n\nThen, they looked closer.  Boy...was I wrong.\n\n The amount of detail they have gone into over the past two year has been amazing.  I discovered I was using incorrect thinking about cost basis.  And when I realized that, I knew I was screwed. \n\n I have been fully cooperating--which is good because they are going to be quick to play the \"evasion\" card.  I actually paid a big bill going into the review to acknowledge I screwed up.  They got paid back their refund...and then a lot.\n\n They went through every transaction on my Coinbase, Trezor, [Gate.io](https://Gate.io), Bittrex, and a couple of MEW wallets.  Ever.  From the first day I traded bitcoin in May 2013. \n\nEvery move, every buy, every sale.  Now, keep in mind we are talking the big run of 2017, BCH drops, ETH trades and a bunch of ICOs.  There are about 1400 transactions, but then you need to account for every move OUT of one wallet to another.  If you can tie them together, there is no impact.  But if you sent stuff out to other addresses and you cannot identify it and establish where it was...its a sale.\n\n So, here is how its going.  After two years and some pretty intense discussions (all of it amicable), it has come to pass that the IRS has engaged a third party vendor they use to calculate cost basis and capital gains.  This third party will take the ledger files of all of your wallets and combine them into a single transaction list.  They will calculate your cost basis and taxable income.  The IRS will present this to me.  Then we can \"discuss.\"\n\n Now, here are some important things to note:  I had two Bitcoin Q wallets (large and small.) at the very start of my BTC life.  One I called the \"large\" wallet.  The other the small wallet.  One had a couple of large deposits from bulk buys and sales.  Not a big deal.  I actually had those records.  It took a week to download the blockchain...but I ended up with the detail.\n\nThe \"small\" wallet had hundreds of small transactions.  When I got my trezor, I moved everything to the trezor and never gave this \"small\" wallet any thought.  It now sits on a broken hard drive or lost USB drive.  I've torn my home apart looking for it.  That stupid little wallet is going to be the death of me.  There are no coins in the wallet, but there ARE hundreds of transfers all around to and from the wallet that I cannot \"prove.\"\n\nObviously, tying a sale to a specific purchase is easy.  You subtract one from the other...and the difference is your gain or loss.  Easy Peasy.  Just make sure you can do that and account for every single move you have every made in your crypto life.\n\n**Every time I sent something out of the wallet and I cannot tie to a real sale, or an exchange for good (like a financial Report) is considered a sale.** That taxable income is based on the cost basis--and these little sales will change every cost basis from 2016 to 2022.  It screws up thousands of transactions. \n\n**Every time you get bitcoin or any other crypto coming into your account and you cannot account for the purchase, it is assumed that the income crypto is INCOME.**  And that is the cost of the unit for your cost basis.\n\nThose two things added up to tens of thousands in \"capital gains\" AND \"income\" they say haven't been reported.  We've whittled away at that number....but its still bigger than I want it to be.\n\nThroughout the process I have been asked such \"rookie\" questions such as, \"When you move crypto from wallet to wallet in a Trezor, do you pay a commission or pay a network fee?\"  Scary, huh?\n\nMy point is that some of the people you will be dealing with have little or no experience with this process.  Years ago I was audited for a small business and at least the examiner and I \"spoke\" the same language--we might have have disagreed, but at least I understood where he was coming from--and he knew what I was saying.  No so with Crypto.  They have specialists who are always in training.  Listen to what they asking to verify that its even \"correct.\"  My examiner and I actually had some laughs over their \"crypto ignorance.\"\n\nIts like laughing with the Lion about to eat you.\n\n So...these guys are backed up against the wall.  I signed two extensions--some lasting a year because they were backed up with cases.  And these are the examiners--not the folks doing to tax return back ups. \n\nPart of this is because they NEED to give you six months after your findings to appeal.  And you need at least a full year of \"active examination\" for the appeal to proceed.  They don’t have the staff and they don’t have the time to do this stuff swiftly. \n\nThe downside to that is if they are up against the wall, they will go with their first blush—and that was really, really wrong.\n\n Since I know I am screwed, and I paid more of what I am going to owe...I signed.  And now this can go until Dec 2022. \n\n But, my advice for everyone is to do the following:\n\n**Its not what you know, or think about what you did...its about what you can prove.**\n\n Print out the account report for ALL of your exchanges.  All of your exchanges going back to your first transaction.  Put them in a safe place.\n\n Print out the history of each of your wallets.  Even if you think no one will ever find it.  They will.\n\n List out everything you've bought with bitcoin.  Because that purchase price is going to be a sale.  If you sent it to an address...they are going to identify that address.  When I did my report I just said I bought \"gold\" or financial reports with it.  The gold I have receipts for.  The financial reports...not so much.  They haven't pressed me on  that stuff because they were minor.\n\n The ICOs bought were a pain in the ass because a lot of them were on MetaMask and it would take a fortune to go back rebuild those.  I kept pretty good records of the follow on sales, so that won't be horrible.  But I would have loved to have the records.\n\n If you did any kiosk and peer to peer exchanges, they will want the details.  Names, Dates, etc.\n\nAs best you can, tie one transaction to the next in a daisy chain.  They understand network fees so if you can show you sent 2 of this to a wallet, and then sent it to another wallet..they understand that.  But you have to be able to tie them together and prove it.  This is tough when you aggregate in an off line wallet, and then send them to a single address to sell.\n\nIf you did a lot of trading (say on Coinbase and Robinhood) it can be maddening.\n\n **Do no lie to them.   Never use NEVER or ALWAYS when describing anything to them.**\n\n**Do not ignore their letters.  They don't \"ask\" multiple times.  They will write a couple of times.  Then it will come certified mail.  Then they will toss a lien on your bank account and house.  (THAT did not happen, but I've heard stories.)**\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I've told them, \"I think that's it\"...and then i found a place where I did four or five \"one-off\" transactions that cleared up about $6k in taxable transactions (which was good.)  But, I had to go back and say, \"look what I found.\"  On a couple occasions they've come back and said, \"What was this...we cannot find it anywhere else.  It looks like it went to ‘”Fill in the blank exchange.”  And there I am standing with my pants down.  I had no memory of making that transaction 5 years ago.\n\n If  you are using a third party vendor to assess transactions, make sure you include ALL of your wallets and all moves, transfers, and transactions since Day 1.  Do not assume if you are using a Trezor for some stuff, a Ledger for another, and Coinbase for other stuff that simply linking your API to Coinbase is going to be good enough.  Its not.  They want it all.\n\nEven though their examination will be for a specific year...they will ask to see cost basis.  In my case they cannot go back further to taxable income because the statute time has lapsed.  But, the \"cost basis\" they come up with will affect hundreds of transactions from 2017 through 2022.\n\nThey will expect a \"re-file\" of transactions for those tax years.  Even this year, their finding will likely impact the cost basis for some crypto traded in 2021.  This means I get an extension now or I will literally have to refile in May or June.\n\n The tiny good news is that during this process I found residual tidbits of ETH and Bitcoin in a few small wallets.  Was amounted to $5 in 2017 is considerably more today.  So I was able to pick up a couple hundred dollars. LOL\n\n The process has been frustrating, maddening, and enlightening.  The examining agent and I have become \"friendly.\"  They are wonderful people working for an entirely inept bureaucracy.  While I have gotten my digs in here and there, I guess I have been worn down to being a compliant worker bee.\n\n**You are not smarter than the IRS.  If you watched Ozark and think you can move money around in the US without them seeing it or finding it...you are wrong.  Don't try doing that.**\n\n**Don't lie.  If you are in this situation, suck it up and deal with them.  Get help if you need it.  DO. NOT.LIE.**\n\n They will come at you…not this year, but in 1 to 2 years or later.  They are that backed up.  They will ask for a whole range of detail.  If you do not provide it, with cross references or updates, they will nail you.  That is where it becomes scary.\n\n If anyone lives in the US and they find you have done any dealing in Crypto and you do not “check the box” on the Tax form they will come down hard on you.  Don’t do that.  They told me that is the first thing they will cross reference.\n\nSo, after two years I've finally submitted every note, spreadsheet, download, or report that I can find displaying my crypto history.  There are no more Merlin Cryto secrets.  They have it all.  Its up to their Wizards.\n\nThey will come back with a number that I can negotiate, dispute, or appeal.  I am pretty sure I won't have the money or inclination to fight this further.  I can pay their fine, get Jussie'd out of \"IRS jail\" and get on with my life.  When someone in your family has PC, you do not dwell on shit.  Even when its been gone for two years.\n\n The only thing that makes me smile is the knowledge that somewhere there are a bunch of college kids who made $50k in Dogecoin last year.  Or Shiba.  And they either blew it on Spring Break or they tried to hide it (They watch too much Ozark.). And these kids are going to have to claim that revenue on their Taxes, their parent’s taxes, and their FAFSA.  Financial Aid will get dropped.  And parents will be on the hook for their kids taxes…AND their own modest tax rate could get bumped up to another rate.  \n\nThat might be fun to watch as I emerge on the other end of the IRS colon\n\nMy best advice is be very careful.  Be honest.  And be prepared to show you work...just like a 7th grade algebra test.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.  I will do my best to answer them.

The 10 year negative rate rose from -1.17 to -0.73 and BTC fell from \\~68,000 to $41,800 so far....an almost exact match of about 37.6% and 38% respectively. 10-year nominal rates are expected to reach 2% to 2.25% which - while inflation remains high (assuming it doesn't change at all) will put the real rate yields near -0.49 to -0.24.  Worst case scenario that we can predict is -1.17 to -0.24 or about 20.5% meaning BTC can reach $13,940 down from $68,000. \n\nI ran the numbers for February 2021 lowest rate and March 2021 highest rate, and correlated it to the drop in price as well.\n\nReal rate yields changed 53.7% and BTC changed 48.1%.\n\nI don't know why the timing was skewed but I figured it might have to do with massive FOMO and retailers and exuberance.\n\nThe latest rally was more sobering and concentrated to professionals so it dropped more timely and more precisely.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 17, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ryk657/btc_13900_is_possible/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

It was removed because it mentions \"shitcoins\".  I'm not sure how that subreddit can pretend to have any meaningful discourse while simultaneously labeling everything else in the cryptocurrency industry as a \"shitcoin\".  To me it further shows that Bitcoin investors are using more of a faith-based approach versus a pragmatic approach.**  \n\nI'd like to outline my thesis on Bitcoin for 2022 and beyond. I have been involved in BTC for a long time and I have been very bullish on the network in the past. However, I don't believe in falling in love with an asset. I believe in constantly reviewing your thesis, since the industry and environment are highly dynamic.\n\nSo, here are my criticisms on BTC and why I think it will underperform in the short/mid term:\n\n* Bitcoin Network lacks the maneuverability to implement changes &amp; new technology. This is for several reasons.  \n\n   * First, the network's strength is its longevity and security. We are very careful for any modifications we make to the network as a whole, because we worry that any change could bring in a vulnerability. For that reason, BTC network is very slow to implement updates and changes tend to be very minor.\n   * Second, BTC is decentralized and has no specific organization cemented as leaders. Therefore, simple changes are often disputed and have even resulted in forking the community. The creator of BTC is an anonymous person who hasn't appeared in a decade. Therefore, there is no voice of leadership, which could provide concrete direction.\n   * Third, Bitcoin was of course the first network ever launched. Therefore, it is based on the most simple, albeit functional, technology. It lacks smart contract support and requires a second layer for any type of feasible scaling.\n* Lightning Network has been too slow to gain adoption. Competing networks have already leapfrogged Bitcoin in terms of second layer solutions and real usage.  \n\n   * We cannot deny that Ethereum has made big strides on their implementation of Layer 2 technology. There are multiple forms of layer 2's which are all competing and building out projects. ZK-rollups, optimistic rollups, hybrid solutions. I went to a talk on Lightning Network in 2015. Today, it's still very under-utilized.\n* Blockchain Payments are better solved with stablecoins.  \n\n   * Like it or not, BTC and other floating value cryptocurrencies are volatile. Volatility is the enemy of currency. Currency is meant to be stable, the price of an item should not change within 10 minutes of making a purchase. Commerce is still overwhelmingly done in USD and other fiat currencies. Adding a secondary currency to the mix simply complicates transactions. Further, BTC's high value creates awkward payment amounts which are difficult to understand at a quick glance. For example, it's very confusing to convert 0.000025 BTC to USD. It's much easier to convert something like 100,000 VND to USD, even though it has similarly high digits.\n   * Stablecoins are quickly displacing BTC and other cryptocurrencies in payments. This trend is not showing any sign of deceleration.\n   * Please spare me the inflation argument. Inflation in the USD was very low over the past decade. It is obviously much higher today, but the Fed is reacting and controlling inflation is part of their mandate. Further, 5% or even 10% inflation isn't enough to justify BTC price hitting $100K or beyond.\n* Confirmations are too slow for payments  \n\n   * Payments need to be verified near-instantaneously. It is not acceptable to wait 10+ minutes for 1 confirmation.\n* BTC's primary function is as a store of value. Its value is derived from scarcity and demand. When it was the only game in town, and when it was the only project anyone was using, that was enough. However, today there are projects gaining major traction, all of which offer similar forms of scarcity. Digital scarcity is constant in some form throughout the industry. Therefore, it is not enough to warrant being the top project by itself.\n* Other projects are showing up with real useful technology. DeFi seems most relevant at the moment. Blockchain gaming seems to be gaining traction as well. NFT's are very hype-y but long term, their application outside the art world has great potential. BTC has no way to really get involved with these new use cases. It is pigeon holed into payments / single asset network.\n\nSo there you have it. I'm sure you'll be tempted to tell me I'm an asshole, since you are probably a BTC investor. But I'd really love to hear your critical responses to my concerns. I would love to see Bitcoin succeed and continue to dominate the market. I just don't see how to get excited about the project as it is today, especially compared to its peers.", "lang": null, "likes": 4, "replies": 155, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ry9o8y/my_bitcoin_thesis_2022_and_beyond/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Wishing you all the best at this time of the year.\n\nFirst, thank you for all the good stuff you bring to this thread, and making it the best place on the net to discuss Bitcoin insights.\n\nThen, I would like to give back some of my own thoughts of the recent months. I'm very interested in getting your feeback.\nI was not sure whether it should be a separate post / thread or not. Anyway, here it goes.\n\nLike others have said, looking at the minute or even daily moves of the price is futile. Interesting, like a soap drama is, but futile.\n\nSo now that we're at the end of the 4 year cycle, or rather what used to be the 4 year cycle (more ahead), is a good time to try to get the bigger picture and take a look ahead where the price might go in the next cycle.\n\nHowever, predicting price is fun, but there are very few chances that predicted prices actually happen in the predicted way. Rather, what is easier to be predicted are the successsive trends the price will take. And what is actually truly useful is to outline the big underlaying principles that will make them happen.\n\nLet's first take a look backwards. 4 years ago, at the end of the previous cycle, I thought I had nailed it and understood how price would move : more or less like 4 years earlier. This proved mostly correct throughout 2018... except that we had a descending triangle rather than a descending channel. Why ? because bottoms were skimmed.\n\nThis \"small\" change made a big difference at the end of the year, were the price dropped a cliff and got halved from 6k to 3k. And an even bigger difference in the first half of 2019, when this sudden drop gave birth to the complementary opposite reaction : a rally all the way up to 14k. I think it's fair to say that this rally suprised most people, and at least that such a 4 year bear market rally was unprecedented in the whole history of Bitcoin. However, looking back, all of this looks now rather consistent and logical ; rounded bottoms and tops have become the norm rather than the exception, as is the increased RELATIVE volatility of the price even though within less large bounds.\n\nAll of this is nothing new, but this gives us a good overview of how new big trends have increasingly hanged the historical behaviour of Bitcoin, and what are the \"new\" - actually, rather \"updated\" - principles behind price moves. So here they are.\n\nHistorical trends remain :\n\n- price staying within historical regressions. I'm very fond of the one where the bottom line doubles, and the top one increases by half every year. It was a 3k- end of 2017, is now at 25-100k, and will be at 400-500k end of the next cycle (end of 2025). This tightening also shows that soon after or before that, it will have to break, probably down since the bottom line is more unsustainable long term (26000k in 10 years !!). Besides, tops getting skimmed means that we'll probably never see again the upper limits of it.\n- impact of halving every 4 year. However I'm NOT saying that we'll still get a mind-blowing blow-off top after.\n- well known price patterns will repeat... until they are broken. Same for short term and longer term trendlines.\n- Bitcoin price, like all markets, always does the most unexpected move, in order to take money from the majority.\n\nBut they are been modified by big trends such as institutional adoption &amp; ETFs :\n\n- institutional money is big and plays like in other markets to get their share : they use futures to skim off tops and bottoms, making them rounded. So now more blow-off, 80% drop or deep dip with V shaped recovery (black swan like Covid crash being the exception)\n- institutional money wants volatility, so they take advantage of rounded tops and bottoms to push the price in the other direction more than it would be without them.\n- institutional money wants yearly returns, so there is an increased chance that every year will have some kind of \"incredible\" rally, even cycle bear market years, such as the 2019 one.\n- I'd go on a limb and say that institutional money like an appealing product, so if they can get a new high every year they will.\n\nNow that we've got the big principles nailed down, let's use them to draw what would be a possible evolution of the price in the upcoming 4 year cycle. Again, this is the part that is the most fun, but the less useful. Don't trade on these prices, Bitcoin always does the unexpected, and trends will keep on changing. However, it shows how to use the big principles to get a picture of what might come, and have a steadier hand at the helm.\n\n2022 :\n\n- right now, it is plausible to say that what happend in the April-July bear repeats. So after a short relieve (that just happened, up to 52k), price will contine going down sideways, down to 45k up to mid-February. Moreover, institutional money first needs time to get a position again for further 2022 rallies. Yes, China selling pressure will end, but that's not going have an impact on day one.\n\n- Then my idea is that it will be much like the 2018 rally to 10k, because the rally to 12k first only happend because of the 70% drop, which we won't have. we will have a retest of 53k that will first fail, but then succeed in a rally further up ending in May (2 months earlier than last time, like everything seems to happen). And then \"sell in May and go away\". Institutional money needs a nice rally to get their earnings in 2022. Maybe it'll end at 65k, with everyone being dead sure that anyway it'll end only 2k higher (so 71k) ? But it will be a good opportunity to trick them into FOMOing at the top, with the \"extended cycle\" talks. In this case, the new ATH will be defined by a new upper line. A good one is the one going through the 2017 and 2021 tops, which triples every 3 years or so, is now at 70k, at 210k end of 2024 and 1900k end of 2030. This line would define a new ATH at 82k in May.\n\n- then price will at first make people believe price will go to 100k (at last !) and there won't be a 4 year bear market anymore. But whales will milk all these \"100k is next door\" new converts. So still no 100k then. And it will actually break the big trend lines up that remain, probably at 60k start of August, and drop down to 40k or even 30k start of September 2022. BTW, 100k can only happen once everybody is disillusioned and thinks that new attempts are pointless. What made me doubt of 100k end of 2021 was all these \"300k blow-off top\" predictions at the start of the year, like 100k would be a sure thing.\n\n- there it will be all doom and gloom, and people will expect the price to get halved down (like end 2018) to 20k or even 15k, but it most probably won't happen - actually, can't happen anymore. Bear market length went down from 6-9 months in 2014 to 4-6 months in 2018, depending on how bounds are drawn, so this time it would be 2.7-4 months. So it would end before the end of the year, and the price would go back up to 50k, where lies the big trend line and the lower line of the historical regression. Except if institutional money needs more time to get their position at the start of 2023 ; then everybody would fear the big trend line and regression are broken, but I think whales will have more interest in milking their fears and in the end push the price back up. But who knows.\n\n- What's more interesting is that if and when it were to break down, it would have to find support and another trend line to later follow up. The simplest one is a parallel one drawn from the Covid drop bottom, and it merely always sits 25% below it ; it also was a support in the 2015 bear market. 25% lower is not bad, but it still ends up at 300k end of 2025. Another one goes through the 3k and the Covid drop bottoms ; it sat at 5k start of 2020, will be at 40k start of 2025 so gets *8 every 5 years and will be at 320k in 3030. But I think this one is premature at this moment. It will get its time in the limelight, but probably not for years to come.\n\n2023 :\n\n- from there, it seems logical we'll have a big rally, born of the big bear market dip, much like in 2019. Except that back then, 20k hadn't been a skimmed off top, but a blow off top. Note that if 100k has been skimmed to 69k, 20k would have been skimmed down to 14k incidentally ! Where up to ? at least 70k as we've just seen. But I believe that we'll rather see a new high. It is counterintuitive (which is good for whales) at this time of the cycle, but it is the logical conclusion of the \"blow-off top skimming\" principle. And all the more if we didn't get a new ATH in 2022, because then 70k would already be a new ATH, so it will draw a lot of attention. I'll even wager that it'll take 100k, up to 105-140k on said new upper trend line made of the 2017 and 2021 tops. This is where institutional money will get their earnings this year.\n\n- then the price might only fall. I don't know where to or when, maybe the previous 60k tops, repeating this year's pattern of halving down abruptly - again, \"sell in May and go away\". But to follow the regression's bottom line, it has to be above 100k at end of 2023. Will it again ? or will it cling a new bottom line, the one 25% below at 75k ? or free fall to find a new support down, and make everyone fear that the halving effect is gone for good ?\n\nFrom then on :\n\n- in 2024 we'll have the perennial halving short term rally, If it's again 2 months earlier, it'll be too early for institutional money to get their earnings from it, so there would be another rally later that year (after a drop where they can build their position), ending in September. If the price did cling to said trend line, at least one of those would make a new high, up to 170-250k on said trend line.\n\n- now, what's interesting is that at this time and at this price, said 20k-60k tops trend line makes an ascending triangle with the regression's lower bound. So it now has to break. Up or down ? I don't know. My heart says up, in this case up to 240-500k in 2025, but most probably the fabled 300-350k. Indeed, 300k is the previous cycle tops trend line. And 350k is the 70% skimmed off the regression's 500k upper line. But 300k is also the \"25% below\" lower trend line, which means that we would have had to broke it down earlier and find new support. So maybe this time we would have broken it end of 2024 in a catastrophic manner, that would still allow for an institutional money-desired rally in 2025, but with 2025 being still already full cycle bear market. This would be bad for the morale, so maybe it would have broken down earlier, and we would have had a halving rally and post halving rally worth of the name, as in the good old times. In any way, this shows the limits of the exercise, which has now come to an end.\n\nFinally, looking back at this scenario :\n\n- I admit that a new ATH every year is a little bit rosy, like never again going below 40k or 30k even. But so much depends on what will happen by then.\n- next cycle's ATH will very probably be between 240k (previous cycle tops trend line end of 2024, at 300k end of 2025) and 350k (70% of the regression's upper line end of 2025).\n- following an upper line &gt; 300k in 4 years means doing *4, which is more than what the price has done in the current cycle up to now. So I think that there's margin for a new ATH before that, so in the first half of either 2022 or 2023.\n- but beware, long term support lines are far and few below...", "lang": null, "likes": 45, "replies": 130, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/rs7kkc/next_4_years_bitcoin_price_trends_and_predictions/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Here are the recap and observations from our team:\n \nQUICK TAKEAWAYS:\n\nBitcoin declined nearly 20% overnight as the weak price action to end the week extended overnight into a less liquid weekend session. The effects were even more severe on offshore exchanges like Huobi, where bitcoin hit $28,800 at its lowest point.\n\n\n$1.1B of leveraged BTC positions and $2.5B of crypto leveraged positions (including bitcoin) have been liquidated in the past 24 hours.

I want to help other traders (or aspiring traders) get more comfortable with this and learn how to move in this market. I post some setups on reddit, but working on moving myself to a public server so others can get more of my charts and I can help those that are interested.*\n\nOne of the questions or topics I get asked the most is about how to remain level headed when making trades. Of course, this only applies to people that are buying and selling; DCA and HODL strategies are not impacted by this.\n\nMany people have different strategies for how to manage this, but hopefully by providing mine it will help some of those that don't even know where to start. I struggled with this for a long time before I found my strategy and got comfortable with it.\n\nThe two main pieces for me are actually having a plan before making a trade and being confident on my entries to trades. And you HAVE to stick to the plan, too many people say they have a plan but deep down they know that the plan is not flushed out or complete and so they don't follow it.\n\nThe hardest part of this strategy is starting it, once you start it's easy to maintain. Reason for that is you need to wait for the proper entry and sitting on the sidelines is hard for some people because they feel they always need to be in a trade. But the name of the game is to chart any of the coins of interest, I chart BTC and have support/resistance levels and good patterns drawn on all of my charts. I have heavy support levels marked on the charts and in all of the places where you'd thing \"dang, it would be awesome in this pulled back here\". And I mark those levels on a ton of coins I'm interested and I set alerts at or near those levels.\n\nAnd this is the hard part, you wait. Wait for those good entry levels to get hit. If the entire market pumps hard and new levels are reached, I adjust the levels on my charts accordingly but still don't buy in until they are hit. The entire goal here is to buy when the price is on its way down or sideways, not the way up.\n\nAnd then it happens, a market correction or small dip to correct longs occurs. And those targets start to get hit, I start to get alerts that the prices are closing towards my targets. And I scale into them slowly, in the event that the dip goes beyond my targets and I can get an even sweeter price. I do this in a distributed fashion across some of the coins that I'm most interested in and feel they will have best bounce up (this can be based on coin news coming out soon or technical patterns that are stronger than others).\n\nBecause I enter on confidence at those levels, I don't have to worry about the endless dip. I know that if the prices continue to dump below the technical patterns I have drawn, I sell because the pattern I set up for failed. Sure I took a small loss, but we are generally talking no more than 5-7%, not the 40%+ many others take in altcoins. Then we re-analyze the charts with the next support levels, and enter again on those levels because a correction to the upside is bound to be soon if our first targets got demolished. (There are better ways to expect the next bounce support levels, this can be determined by charting BTC with the altcoins of interest; just wanted to clarify it's not randomly done at every support level).\n\nThen the market starts to do it's correction back to the upside. Even if not a big or rapid correction, I am almost immediately in profit because I entered on support. So doing that negatives almost all of the negative/sad emotions of crypto because I ride almost no downtrends, and if I do its very short term. And now we use our charts to look at where the overhead resistance levels will be, we can chart and get an idea of when to expect a pullback or correction in the market. And when I think that correction is around the corner, I sell my holdings. Depending on the market and charting, I will do this in portions as certain resistance levels or targets are reached. I have to know to be happy with my profits.\n\nWhile that uptrend is happening and I am just letting my setups play out, I continue to chart and scope out my next moves. Planning for that next correction or swing downward already. So while I take my profit and wait, I have the game plan already in motion so there are no rush decisions. And as I sit on the sidelines, its a perfect time to reflect on any mistakes I might have made if something didn't go right or learn other technical concepts, etc.", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 78, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/qwdvfq/riskminimization_selfdiscipline/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Bitcoin is almost always either just repeating a pattern it has recently made, mirroring a pattern its made, or flipping the pattern its recently made. That sounds like a lot of possibilities but when you start getting into the weeds you can see where it can occasionally help.\n\nObviously, I cannot tell the future, but I am using a real-time example here for demonstration. This analysis will be 2 parts; the first part showing a pattern bitcoin made recently on 3hr timeframe. And the second part showing a potential repeating pattern happening on 1 hr timeframe.\n\n[BTC 3hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qi0vYAuK/) the main thing to look at here is the section with 3 green triangles. Bitcoin is constantly printing these, it leads to a ton of head and shoulder type of patterns, but they arent always perfectly horizontal (for example the one I am showing is slanted on an angle).\n\nNow if we zoom in to the [BTC 1hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbiIYRbf/) we can find an almost identical formation. These aren't perfectly shaped which can make them more difficult to spot. But there is a chance that we get a repeating pattern and bitcoin is about to have a nice little run again.\n\nI'm not saying I am a fortune teller, but patterns like this show up and play out all the time. You guys always criticize that I never provide any \"predictions\" on my posts and the answer is because predictions are dumb and impossible. But I'm putting it out there now because this is a speculative idea I am currently running with and would love to see if it plays out or doesnt.\n\nRegardless of how it turns out, I would like any other traders or charters to try and back test this idea to see how often it actually works out.

The thread explores Timmer's unique price-performance model. In [THIS](https://mobile.twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1382026394541174787?s=09) thread Timmer suggests that the S2F model is unidimensional, and a model incorporating demand may yield more accurate results.\n  \nHis research suggests that BTC demand thus far has closely followed that of cell phone demand. Timmer extrapolated this logarithmic relationship based on historic BTC data and mapped it against the S2F model. The result is [THIS](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ey3w1DNXEAgz2ZW?format=jpg&amp;name=small) figure which presents a bracketed price model based on the 2 variables.\n  \nThis model suggests an EOY price bracketed by $37.6k (demand) and $98k (S2F). As a long-term holder, I appreciate what I perceive to be a more sensible and subdued approach to price prediction versus those circulating in most BTC circles. The lower bottom end of Timmer's model may be seen as bearish by some. However, I suspect that the bottom end is fairly conservative based on recent market price action which suggests consolidation in the '60s. Ultimately, I view his model as a positive and productive contribution to better understanding BTC price action moving forward.\n\nBeyond the model, I believe it is extremely bullish for BTC to receive analysis as a high-performance asset from this longstanding and reputable TradFi institution.

BTC and BTC.D confluence, have a plan in place! I'm always preaching to find confluence between charts for market moves. And this doesn't always work perfectly, but it is such an edge to this market that most traders do not see.\n\nWe are able to time some really big moves out of Bitcoin by doing some basic technical analysis on bitcoin dominance. And [BTC.D](https://www.tradingview.com/x/926xkxkA/) is currently nearing the end of a really step falling wedge, and we love wedges because they come to an apex.   \n\\*\\*REMEMBER: Bitcoin Dominance does not tell us the direction of a big move, just preludes that a big move may be coming\\*\\*\n\nSo the next step is to look at the Bitcoin chart. [Bitcoin 1hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eRa5xj6B/) shows us that Bitcoin has been in a falling channel since it broke a new all time high. And this makes sense because Bitcoin has needed to cool off and reset funding rates.\n\nStatistically speaking, both of those patterns should break higher, but they could also break lower and it's important to have a plan in place for all scenarios. So here are the 4 scenarios and how they each play out differently.\n\n1. BTC.D and BTC both break higher : Bitcoin breaks higher from the falling channel, the bitcoin rally begins, and BTC.D is increasing because FOMO is driving new money into the market and Bitcoin is pumping like an altcoin\n2. BTC.D and BTC both break lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks lower, most altcoin will remain stable, with few big gainers.\n3. BTC.D breaks higher, BTC breaks lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks higher, all altcoins will get wrecked. When bitcoin goes down and bitcoin dominance goes up, there is blood is the streets.\n4. BTC.D breaks lower, BTC breaks higher : This is a market euphoria scenario. Almost all coins are green, tons of double digit green altcoins. Almost no way to lose in this scenario unless you are late to the party and FOMO at the top.\n\nBut notice that there are only 2 charts here, and we can at least paint some pictures for possibilities. It's important to plan for each scenario because the last thing you want is to wake up in the morning, check your coins to realize your entire portfolio has dropped a zero, and hope that emotion-filled you is going to make the right choice in that moment. You need to check the plan you said you were sticking to, and follow it.\n\nHappy trading!

Just wanted to point out a very basic bullish idea. The all time high of the crypto market has been broken and in the last day the all time high has been retested absolutely perfectly. This is a wonderful sign for the market in the near future. Its such simple basic ideas like this Support/Resistance flip with a valid retest that will make so much more money in crypto than the fancy, overcomplex analysis. It's also very possible that we will retest this level a couple more times soon but the important thing to know is that it will provide good support. If you haven't read between the lines yet, I'll make it obvious: If we get a pullback and the Total market cap pulls back to that support, its a perfect time to consider opening positions. But you need more than this one idea, I'll come back to this in a second.\n\nAnd for the sake of teaching, it's always good to have confluence between multiple ideas. Here is my [USDT Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z14x4MMu/) chart I shared a few days ago saying we had to keep an eye on this double bottom. The support level I have had drawn had a perfect breakout and retest, and this matched our ideas with the Total chart above. Again, confirms the bullish sentiment in the market.\n\n[Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/akSRW2cC/) is quickly approaching the neckline of the double bottom. Keep in mine, where I put the neckline may not be exact, but there is definitely a resistance zone in that area.  \nAnd a [Bitcoin 2hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jea6hA2A/) chart to compliment the BTC.D chart. A couple days ago I mentioned an upward break of a rising channel is mega bullish. Turns out that was the case, and it even gave us an iconic retest. That formed another rising channel earlier today and that even broke higher and now we are headed to ATH. I'm mostly showing this to display where resistance levels may be for those traders that are looking for small dips to buy in. I extended the rising channels because those will provide support in the event of pullbacks. And all of the dashed purple lines in the background will provide support as well. I even left my alert line on the chart because I'm a nice guy :)\n\nAnd now we have to tie it all together. I mentioned I would come back to an idea I mentioned in the first paragraph. Find confluence between multiple ideas! Don't buy just because the TOTAL chart cane back to support, that doesnt mean your particular coin of interest is done dropping (maybe yours didnt even pullback!) Find support levels on the coin you want to buy, wait for the pullbacks to line up between the TOTAL (TOTAL2 and TOTAL3 are good too depending on the coin of interest). Look at the BTC.D chart and find its resistance and support. Buy in on confluence and you will not lose!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions welcome.

And always do things in scaled intervals, I mentioned before to scale into Bitcoin on any pullbacks and retests, and it happens that we just so happen to be retesting the rising channel. Here is a zoomed in [Bitcoin chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iUD7Ir5q/). Look at a couple older posts to see other potential support levels for buying in.\n\nAnd [Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oZmfkj6w/) is at a breaking point. Being squeezed between overhead resistance and a rising channel. Remember that dominance does not tell us the direction of the move, but it does warn us when something is about to happen. Odds are heavily stacked that this will break downward (because rising channels break downward most often AND because this overhead resistance has been tested FOUR TIMES in less than a week).\n\nBTC.D trending down is often an indicator for good altcoin trading, but because the market is so overextended, and it's likely we see some short term bad news for bitcoin (any single ETF not passing), its most likely that an entire market correction would happen, which would mean bitcoin pulls back and altcoins get dragged down hard with it. \n\nMy strategy is always that if odds aren't heavily in my favor, then I'm not trading. So for these reasons, I'm sitting on the sidelines right now.\n\nQuestions welcome.", "lang": null, "likes": 25, "replies": 34, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/qa0817/bitcoin_etfs_fomo_things_im_watching_as_we_go/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

In fact, I strongly discourage most people to use derivatives as they are leveraged investments and can easily go against you and result in losses that go beyond what you have in your trading account. The risk is even greater with highly volatile investments like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Furthermore, derivatives require a very active management and quickly become time consuming. Studies have shown that simple buy and hold - HODL! - strategies have systematically outperformed derivative investments and I strongly recommend that this is what the majority of people should do. However, even if one is not investing in options, they can be really useful tools to interpret what the market may or may not do and the idea here is to exchange views and opinions and these interpretations. I’m also writing this just as much for myself as for anyone else as it helps me keep track of my investment process and gain valuable insight from others’ opinions. If this might be of interest read on. If not please skip this post and rest assured that HODLing is much safer and more lucrative than trading options.)\n\n**Follow up**\n\nI posted a couple of days ago a trade idea which you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pj9sz7/option_trade_idea_sell_bitcoin_50k_covered_call/). I wanted to put on this trade because my feeling was that we had reached a ceiling with the 52k level and while I still wanted to benefit from some upside if we kept on rallying I also wanted to protect my BTC investment from a pullback which I felt could come from some negative regulatory scrutiny. My target trading range was 45k / 55k.\n\nLow and behold BTC took a severe beating a few hours later due to the negative news from the SEC taking interest in the Coinbase lending program. Luck must have been on my side because I couldn’t have possibly timed this if I had wanted to - in fact that’s why I chose a medium term 60 DTE maturity for the trade as I didn’t expect the correction to come so soon.\n\nBy selling the 50k BTC Oct21 Calls on Wednesday we collected 0.15 btc ($7.8k) of premium and at time of writing they are trading around 0.1 ($4.5k) therefore locking in a 0.05 ($2.3k) unrealized profit from the decrease in the value of the option. However, since this is a delta neutral trade the long delta hedge 0.5 btc per option has cost us around 0.06 btc ($3k) due to the 10% drop in the value of btc from 52k to 46k.\n\nAs intended this trade has mitigated our losses from the correction as the decrease in the value of the option has more or less compensated for the drop in the price of the underlying.\n\n**What now?**\n\nThere is still a fair amount of premium in the option therefore we are going to hold the position since the general consensus is that the market will not bounce back quickly and we are looking at a trading range of 40k / 50k for the weeks to come which means that theta decay will chip away at the value of the option netting us some additional profit.\n\nSince we remain bullish it might be a good time to purchase some additional spot since this will enable us to buy some “cheap” btc so we don’t miss out on the next rally while also counteracting the increase in premium of our short call position if the market does move up. That being said macro news may weigh on btc and crypto in general with Fed starts tapering in Q4 so we will be cautious in our btc spot purchase by averaging our buying.\n\n**Was this the best trade or would there have been better trades?**\n\nIn the initial post u/LoudOrganization6 suggested selling a 65k strike instead of the 50k. This would have been more suitable for someone more bullish than me and would have captured only 0.05 ($2.6k) btc of premium by selling the 65k call strike for the same expiry. The idea was to maximize the premium income which is why we opted for a slightly ITM call to match our short term bearish outlook.\n\nAnother combo by u/LoudOrganization6 would have been to sell a 60k strike Call (0.08 btc) and buy a 45k Put (0.7 btc) which is essentially a Collar. The sale of the Call would have paid for the purchase of the Put. At time of writing the 60k Call is now worth 0.04 btc and the Put 0.12 btc. With hindsight this would have been a much better trade than the Covered Call trade although it would have hurt a bit more in the short term if the market had kept on rallying with the increase in the premium of the call and the collected premium having been used up to pay for the long put.\n\nAs always tits jacked !", "lang": null, "likes": 15, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/plwfzd/follow_up_bitcoin_50k_covered_call_29_oct_2021/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I’m currently long 0.17 BTC (~$8.6k). Long term I am bullish on bitcoin and crypto in general. However, for the medium term (end of october) my feeling is that BTC is struggling to push through the 52k resistance level. Even if we do break out I don’t see us going any higher than the next 56k resistance level by the end of october. In fact, I think crypto will undergo some regulatory scrutiny during that period which will trigger a pull back to 45k maybe even 40k level.\n\nSo my problem is how do I protect my long position in case of a pull back while also capturing some of the upside?\n\nLet’s consider the following scenario if I do nothing and keep my position as is (I did some rounding for ease of reading) based on my current position 0.17 BTC (~$8.6k) \n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 52k = $8.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 55k = $8.6k + $0.4k = $9k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 60k = $8.6 + $1.4k = $10k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 45k = $8.6k - $2k = $6.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @ 40k = $8.6k - $1.2k = $7.4k\n\nAs we can see if the market rallies I capture some upside but I have a fair amount of downside risk as well.\n\nNow let’s consider selling 0.5 x 50k Call 29 Oct 2021 Expiry all things being equal (i.e. no change in volatility)\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 52k : pnl today 0 / pnl expiry $8.6k + $3k  = 11.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 55k : pnl today +$0.2k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $2.4k = 12k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 60k : pnl today -$0.8k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $1k = $9.6k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 45k : pnl today +$0.2k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $2.4k = $12k\n\nBTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 40k : pnl today 0 / pnl expiry $8.6k + $1k = $9.6k\n\nBest case scenario BTC stays within the 45k / 55k range and my profit is $2.4k. Even if we go much higher I would only start losing money if we go above 64k by the end of october. Likewise if we go much lower I would only start losing money if we got below 34k in that time period.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[screenshot of payout simulation](https://imgur.com/a/4Cm7qU4)", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 54, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pj9sz7/option_trade_idea_sell_bitcoin_50k_covered_call/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Today I decided to take a look at Bitcoin  (daily) as ETH took center stage yesterday and did a number on those  bears. Bitcoin decided it was going to follow last night and we  approached resistance. 50k... This 50k resistance is sure a thorn in the  side of the bulls. Speaking of resistance, ETH crushed the resistance  at 3600 which is likely the most recent catalyst to the current bullish  momentum. At least in my opinion.\n\nI see a  possible ascending right triangle pattern, which is generally considered  bullish. These patterns do not always break out as advertised so make  sure you set a stop loss.  There have been consistent higher lows  (bullish) recently and that makes up the bottom of the ascending  triangle. The top is marred by the resistance at 50k. Something's gotta  give. RSI is still low enough for us to break the resistance at 50k.  Time will tell if this comes to pass.   \n\n\nI am  going slightly off topic here to discuss stop losses on small cap  coins. I understand that sometimes some of you set a stop loss on  these  low cap coins. Then complain about how the stop losses do not trip  consistently. The likely reason for this is low liquidity is to blame.  If you dont have buyers then your stop loss won't trip. That is why I  prefer trading big cap coins like BTC or ETH. There is a reliable amount  of liquidity to trade with confidence in your stop loss. Just something  I wanted to discuss as I have noticed this pattern. People complain  about their stop not tripping. Even trading Bitcoin can result in  skipped stops. But it's much more rare due to the massive liquidity  Bitcoin possesses.

BTC formed a peak of about $48,245, and the price began to fall. It shattered the support levels of $47,500 and $47,000. \n\n**Coinbase BTC Outflow**\n\nData fom TBEN Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC/USD has hit lows of  $46,530on Bitstamp in one day. It is the lowest the coin has experienced since August 27.\n\nIt traded around the support area of $46,500 and formed a low area of about $46,540.  It is now consolidating the losses near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decrease from the $48,245 swing high to $46,540. Bitcoin is currently gaining again and trading at $47,686.71.\n\nFor Willy Woo, an analyst, who echoed this week’s findings, Bitcoin is likely to maintain a large pool of support in the current ranges.  BTC has a pricing base ranging from $45,000 to $50,000 for over 1.65 million of them.\n\nHe said on Twitter that Bitcoin is approaching a price stability region. The zone around $51,000 is set to crumble at the mid-level. It is a final obstacle level to Bitcoin. The timing for this is quite a mystery.\n\n**Investors See the Light**\n\nIn turn, investors seemed to go on the day with reserves on Coinbase recording the [lowest](https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-drop-1000/) since December 2017. There are only 700,000 BTC and about $20 billion in stablecoins in centralized trading platforms ready for exchange. During the May sell-off, there was quite some BTC inflow. Coinbase is currently experiencing a large outflow of coins, according to Glassnode.\n\nCointelegraph contributor Michael van de Poppe however, sees nothing much in the news. He insists that it is just business as usual for BTC as it goes through consolidation.\n\n**Ethereum is Rallying**\n\nEthereum formed a base for a sustained gain at $3,250 and began. The price of the ETH cleared the resistance levels of $3,350 and $3,380.\n\nIt even rose above the $3,400 zone and was significantly above the 100-hour average. Nearly $3,477 was established before a downside reversal took place. The price was lower than 3,400 dollars, but the bulls were active at around $3,350.\n\nOvernight ETH/USD exceeded $ 3,500, the highest over the US Dollar and the BTC in three months. Its cryptocurrency market cap dominance climbed to 20.4 percent, with bitcoin holding steady at 44 percent.\n\nSuccessful bulls could lead to larger gains than $3,480. The next biggest resistance is close to $3,500. Once crossed, it may lead to another break above the $3,500 resistance. Ether may rise to the level of $3,600 in the given instance.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-bitcoin-btc-since-2017/](https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-bitcoin-btc-since-2017/)", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pg6udp/coinbases_bitcoin_btc_outflow_highest_since/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

I have the 4hr pulled up today for BTC and we can see  that we are clearly in consolidation at this point. That can be a good  thing or a bad thing depending on your positions. As we approach the end  of the triangle I drew I expect a move to occur. This could be just a  breather before the bulls recommence the rocket ride north. If the bears  win this triangle we can revisit 44k. 44k looks to be support. Albeit  minor support.   \n\n\nThe 200 MA lies below us at  around 45k. This is only the 4hr 200 MA so it is not quite as solid as  the daily 200 MA. But I still appreciate the reliability of the 200 MA.  Even on the 4hr time frame. The daily 200 MA is sitting just above the  4hr 200 MA at around 46k. So support is quite abundant and as a result  the bulls may pull another bull candle on us... No guarantees though so  set that stop loss traders.  \n\n\nI pointed out  the 100 EMA. Many people ask me why I mix Moving averages (MA's) and  Exponential moving averages (EMA's) and all I can really claim is  through rigorous time and effort reading charts on the regular I saw a  lot of reason to keep the 100 EMA in my repertoire. We can see it  clearly is support on the 4hr time frame anyways. One thing I noticed is  every time we test the 100 EMA we seem to go a bit more south in  relation to where the 100 EMA lies. With each test we drop just a bit  more. Just keep an eye on the 4hr 100 EMA as if we lose it I believe we  may just drop to approximately 44k...\n\nRight now  my best advice to play this pattern is to do what I do. Go long and set  a good stop loss. If we break up I get profit. If not my stop will trip  and I may lose a bit but I plan to make up for that on the bounce.

Fortunately enough, however, at the recently concluded ‘The B-Word’ conference, Musk said that Tesla would ‘most likely’ resume the bitcoin payments service soon.\n\nSimilarly, Wall Street giants have also been vying to add bitcoin to their list of offerings on the back of the rising demand from accredited investors and private clients.\n\nAs recently reported by BTCManager, Wells Fargo had filed for a passive bitcoin fund with the U.S. SEC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/institutional-bullish-bitcoin-btc-50000-resistance/](https://btcmanager.com/institutional-bullish-bitcoin-btc-50000-resistance/)", "lang": null, "likes": 26, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/p9o02w/rising_institutional_adoption_bullish_momentum/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Today I  decided to continue my look into BTC. I will do ETH again I promise.  Anyways, BTC did exactly as expected... We filled that bull gap as soon  as the close yesterday (pretty much) It wouldn't net you a trillion  dollars or anything but I always enjoy setting a winning trade at the  beginning of the week. Support held throughout the lower volume weekend.  But can it continue?\n\nWe are approaching a sort  of \"squeeze point\" which in essence is a place on the chart where the  candles become locked in (in this instance between ascending support and  the resistance at 48k). We have 2 factors I want to bring up. First of  all, RSI is very high. We should all know by now what that means  (bearish) but we also understand that the RSI is not very reliable on  its own. We also have the ascending right triangle pattern we are in  currently and from past experience these patterns are typically  considered bullish. But with RSI the way it is I highly recommend a stop  loss!\n\nWe have had 4 solid weekly closes. Each  candle was around a 6k gain give or take. The bulls seem intent on  taking us to the resistance around 50k but we need volume to get there.  Perhaps the bears strike? Don't lose hope. This is like a dance.  Sometimes the bulls lead. Sometimes the bears lead. If you can navigate  these changes you can make some decent profit bear or bull. The evidence  is right there on the charts folks!

What needs  to happen with this current candle is it needs to close above $45,220.  That is the current price I have my eyes on. That 200 MA is not going to  give up quietly and we really need to separate ourselves from the  support with a good green candle.\n\nBitcoin looks  great if you are a bull but I still recommend setting a stop loss.

We crept into the 46k range this  morning and I expect that the western hemisphere will wake up to a  collective sigh of relief. But there is still work to be done! I took  some time this morning to look into possible future resistance. And I  can see around 50k we see many instances of support and resistance so  that is the real next hurdle IMO. But we still have some ground to cover  in order to climb to 50k..\n\nRSI suggests a  possible pull back but with the recent developments (breaking of the 200  MA) the RSI may take a backseat to fomo buyers. As bullish as any of us  may be we still need to remember risk management is key to ensuring  your gains stay gains. As long as we remain above the 200 MA we are in  decent shape and it may take some time but RSI will catch up if we can  maintain these gains. The entire premise of the bull run not being over  begins with holding onto the recently gained 200 MA. IMO this is the  line in the sand. If it holds we are bullish. If we lose the 200 MA it's  not so bullish.   \n\n\nETH looks great and from a  technical standpoint ETH is more bullish than even BTC. But if a big  move up or down happens for either coin they will follow each other. The  ETH market cap is 40% of Bitcoin. That is significant. So yes I do  believe ETH can lead the pack.

Sources close to the bank have hinted that the fund, which is only available to clients of JPMorgan’s Private Bank, currently has no investors but the firm is seriously pitching the bitcoin investment vehicle to prospective investors, according to reports on August 5, 2021.\n\n**JPMorgan Delving Deeper into Bitcoin**\n\nAfter several months in the works, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, has finally launched its bitcoin (BTC) fund in a landmark move that shows the cryptocurrency ecosystem is gradually coming of age.\n\nPer sources close to the matter, the passively managed bitcoin fund was developed in collaboration with New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) and the team has made it clear that it will be available to only a select group of its wealthy clients.\n\nNotably, JPMorgan has described its new bitcoin investment offering as the safest and cheapest fund available on the private markets. The firm has also hinted that the fund may be converted to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) when the Securities and Exchange Commission finally starts greenlighting them.\n\n**Bitcoin’s Legitimacy Rising Steadily**\n\nJPMorgan’s complete transformation from being a totally bitcoin-averse financial institution to one that has now embraced the super volatile cryptocurrency with open arms goes a long way to show that the long-time rhetoric held by critics that bitcoin is just a tool for fraudsters, has lost its authenticity.\n\nEven JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in September 2017, described bitcoin (BTC) as a ‘fraud” destined to blow up, adding that “the currency isn’t going to work. “You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart. I would fire any of my workers trading bitcoin in a second, for two reasons: it is against our rules and they are stupid, and both are dangerous,” Dimon said at the time.\n\nMore recently, in March 2021, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [argued](https://btcmanager.com/blockchain-association-hold-talks-with-regulators-over-amenable-regulations/) that bitcoin poses immense danger to both the public and investors.\n\n&gt;“I don’t think that bitcoin …is widely used as a transaction mechanism. To the extent, it is used I fear it’s often for illicit finance. It’s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,” he said \n\nWith global institutional interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies steadily increasing, it is expected that the legitimacy of these innovative digital assets will continue to move in an upward trajectory.\n\nAt press time, the price of bitcoin ([BTC](https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-price/)) is sitting around $38,151, with a market cap of $715.24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nArticle: [https://btcmanager.com/jpmorgan-unveils-private-bitcoin-btc-fund-for-wealthy-investors/](https://btcmanager.com/jpmorgan-unveils-private-bitcoin-btc-fund-for-wealthy-investors/)", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/oythfi/jpmorgan_unveils_private_bitcoin_btc_fund_for/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Brazilian bitcoin miner Ray Nasser had posted on YouTube that his company was negotiating with Aramco to utilize excess energy produced by the Oil company to mine BTC. \n\n&gt;“We are negotiating with Aramco. All black liquid \\[oil\\] that comes out of the desert belongs to this company. All the flared gas they’re not using, and that’s public information, I can tell you, it’s enough to ‘power up’ half of the bitcoin network today, from this company alone,” he stated. \n\nAramco swiftly denied these claims in a statement issued on Monday.\n\n&gt;“With reference to recent reports claiming that the company will embark on bitcoin mining activities, Aramco confirms that these claims are completely false and inaccurate.”\n\nBitcoin mining requires a large amount of energy which Aramco has readily supply. The company produces a significant chunk of the world’s oil supply and can channel energy from the gas flaring process towards bitcoin mining with minimal operating costs. \n\nSome oil companies have looked to leverage this opportunity by using excess gas power to mine bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, an American mining company was reported to have shipped portable bitcoin mining equipment to oil and gas firms for mining activities. \n\n**Aramco and Blockchain Technology**\n\nAramco is no stranger to blockchain technology and currently deploys DLT within its system. It uses the technology within its supply management operation to standardize business processes and increase efficiency while reducing costs. \n\nIn addition, the oil giant has invested in two blockchain projects: Data Gumbo and VAKT that aims to develop management and automation of new contracts and invoices. This investment shows the company’s commitment to taking a foothold in the fast-growing blockchain industry. \n\nHowever, launching a bitcoin mining operation could be tricky giving the recent commitments of the Saudi oil company. Aramco revealed in 2019 that it was committed to achieving a zero net gas flaring operation by 2030.  Bitcoin mining has its controversies with energy consumption and it remains to be seen if the oil giant would be willing to reconsider its current stance in the future.\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/saudi-aramco-denies-reports-on-bitcoin-mining-activity/](https://btcmanager.com/saudi-aramco-denies-reports-on-bitcoin-mining-activity/)", "lang": null, "likes": 33, "replies": 25, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/owot02/saudi_aramco_denies_reports_on_bitcoin_mining/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Hi there,\n\nfor about 2 months I am using grind trading on Binance and Kucoin. On Kucoin I use a very wide range without leverage for the long term, on Binance I create rather narrow grids for the short term when I expect a time of sideways action, especially after strong price action. For these short-term Grids, I use \"high\" leverage, usually an x10.\n\nNow I was wondering what would happen in case of leveraging a wide grid for the long term (let's say BTC Grid range 22000 - 100.000, 149 steps, x10 leverage). How high would be the risk of liquidation in a grid with x10 leverage? I was playing around in excel and I am normally mathematical experienced but couldn't figure out how the risk of liquidation changes while running a grid. Is there a risk of liquidation at all due to the constant averaging down in the grid? And if there is a risk of liquidation, how could I calculate the amount of margin to avoid liquidation of my x10 futures?\n\nWould be happy to get some ideas from you. Or maybe someone already has experience in this approach.", "lang": null, "likes": 5, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/otwd5b/how_can_i_assess_the_risk_of_liquidation_in_wide/", "subreddit": "BitcoinMarkets"}

Are there others? Are they safe or is this risky business?\n\n**Is this actually better than just selling?** I keep thinking maybe I'm overcomplicating this and should just sell $4k of Bitcoin, pay the taxes, and be done with it.

But this sideways price action isn't a sign of weakness—it’s a byproduct of market mechanics.\nFor most of December, we’ve been trapped in a \"Gamma Pin.\" There is a massive concentration of options sitting right at our current price levels. This forces market makers (dealers) to hedge their positions constantly:\n• As we dip toward $85k: Dealers have to buy to stay neutral.\n• As we push toward $90k: Dealers have to sell to stay neutral.\nThis creates an artificial ceiling and floor. It’s not that traders lack conviction; it’s that the \"Big Money\" is forced to keep the price in a box to manage their own risk. This is why we feel \"stuck\" even while gold and equities are hitting new highs.\nThat pressure is about to vanish. Roughly $27 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire this week, wiping out over 50% of the total open interest in the market. Once that \"gamma pressure\" decays, the invisible walls at $85k and $90k disappear.\nHistorically, when this kind of artificial suppression ends during low volatility, the price snaps toward the direction of the heaviest positioning. Right now, positioning is heavily skewed toward Calls with strikes sitting significantly higher than current levels.\nThe range wasn’t distribution—it was containment.

I run Monaco CPA, where I focus on crypto tax.\n\nI got into this by helping friends and family figure out their crypto situations. Then friends of friends. Then strangers on the internet. The questions kept getting harder, so I kept going deeper.\n\nWhen I'm not buried in transaction histories, I'm usually losing golf balls or hunting for the best donuts in the US. Always open to recommendations.\n\nThis isn't advice for your specific situation-just how I think about Bitcoin and taxes. The basics, the long-term stuff, and some angles that don't come up much.\n\n**What Matters Now**\n\nHolding Bitcoin isn't taxable. But actually using it—spending it, swapping it for another crypto, or using it as collateral in DeFi—usually is. The IRS treats crypto as property, so any time you dispose of it, you're triggering a potential gain or loss.\n\nIf you receive BTC from mining, work, staking, or rewards, it's generally taxable when you have \"dominion and control\"—basically, when you can actually sell or transfer it. The value at that moment becomes your cost basis going forward. This comes from Rev. Rul. 2023-14.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: if your staking rewards are locked with a mandatory unbonding period, you might be able to argue that income recognition is deferred until the tokens are actually accessible. Fair warning though—the IRS hasn't issued specific guidance on this, so it's a defensible position but not settled law. Could be challenged.\n\nOn holding periods: under a year gets taxed as ordinary income (up to 37% federal). Over a year gets the long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income.\n\n**2026 Long-Term Capital Gains Brackets (from Rev. Proc. 2025-32):**\n\n|Rate|Single|Married Filing Jointly|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0%|Up to $49,450|Up to $98,900|\n|15%|$49,451 – $545,500|$98,901 – $613,700|\n|20%|Over $545,500|Over $613,700|\n\nIf you're a high earner, don't forget the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax kicks in above $200K (single) or $250K (married). Those thresholds aren't indexed for inflation, by the way—they're set in stone under IRC 1411. So the effective top federal rate on investment income is really 23.8%.\n\n**The New Recordkeeping Situation**\n\nThis is a big deal that not enough people are talking about.\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, the IRS killed \"universal pooling\" for cost basis. Under the final regs (T.D. 10000) and Rev. Proc. 2024-28, you now have to track basis per-wallet or per-account. You can't sell Bitcoin on Coinbase and use a purchase you made on Kraken to determine your basis anymore.\n\nWhat happens if you transfer BTC to an exchange without providing your acquisition info? The broker might report your basis as \"unknown\" or just leave it blank. That puts 100% of the burden on you to prove what you actually paid. Some bigger custodians are starting to issue voluntary transfer statements, but most retail users aren't getting that.\n\n**Form 1099-DA timeline:**\n\n* 2025: Brokers report gross proceeds only (basis is optional)\n* 2026 and beyond: Basis reporting becomes mandatory for \"covered\" assets (stuff acquired after 2025)\n\nBottom line: we've moved from \"report what you want and hope for the best\" to \"prove your basis or potentially pay tax on the full amount.\"\n\n**The \"basis orphan\" problem.** A lot of early Bitcoin holders bought on multiple exchanges, moved everything to cold storage, and kept terrible records. If you're in that boat, transferring those old coins to a new exchange without documentation could mean the exchange reports zero or unknown basis. That's a problem. If this is you, start consolidating and documenting now. Chain forensics, old CSVs, bank statements—whatever you can dig up will help.\n\n**Where Things Get More Interesting**\n\n**Never selling—literally.** Some people plan to hold their Bitcoin until they die. Sounds morbid, but there's real logic here.\n\nWhen you die, your heirs get a stepped-up basis under IRC Section 1014. So if you bought BTC at $10K and it's worth $500K when you pass, your heirs inherit it at $500K. They can sell immediately and owe nothing.\n\n|Scenario|Original Basis|Value at Death|Sale Price|Taxable Gain|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|You sell during life|$10,000|—|$500,000|$490,000|\n|Heirs sell after inheritance|$10,000|$500,000|$500,000|$0|\n\nOne thing to watch: Congress has proposed eliminating stepped-up basis multiple times. It hasn't passed, but the legislative risk is real.\n\n**Borrowing against it instead of selling.** Some folks take out loans using their Bitcoin as collateral. You get cash, no taxable event—because borrowing isn't income.\n\nBut there are real risks:\n\n* If BTC drops and you get liquidated, that's a taxable sale at the worst possible time\n* Counterparty risk is real (ask anyone who used Celsius or BlockFi)\n* Interest eats into your returns\n\n**Retirement accounts.** This is one of the most powerful tools that people underuse.\n\nYou can hold Bitcoin inside a Roth IRA or Solo 401(k) through a self-directed custodian:\n\n* **Roth IRA:** You pay tax on contributions, but growth and withdrawals are tax-free forever. Bitcoin 100x inside a Roth? Zero capital gains tax. Ever.\n* **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions might be deductible, growth is tax-deferred, withdrawals get taxed as ordinary income.\n* **Solo 401(k):** If you're self-employed, the contribution limits are way higher.\n* **Brokerage windows:** Some employer 401(k) plans let you access a brokerage window where you can buy Bitcoin ETFs inside the tax-advantaged wrapper.\n\n**2026 Contribution Limits (per IRS Notice 2025-67):**\n\n|Plan Type|Standard Limit|Catch-Up (50-59, 64+)|Super Catch-Up (60-63)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|401(k) / Solo 401(k)|$24,500|$8,000|$11,250|\n|Traditional / Roth IRA|$7,500|$1,100 (now indexed)|N/A|\n|Total Solo 401(k)|$72,000|$80,000|$83,250|\n\n**SECURE 2.0 wrinkle:** If your W-2 wages were over $145K last year (or $150K for 2026), your catch-up contributions have to go into a Roth. The transition period technically ended 12/31/2025, but final regs delay enforcement to 2027 for most plans.\n\nHere's a different way to think about it: yes, you lose the immediate deduction. But if you believe Bitcoin is going to grow significantly, paying tax now for tax-free growth later might actually be the better deal.\n\n**QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock).** Some investors who've made big gains on Bitcoin redeploy into qualifying startups.\n\nUnder the OBBBA (for stock acquired after July 4, 2025):\n\n|Feature|Before|After|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Holding for 100% exclusion|5+ years|5+ years|\n|Tiered exclusions|None|50% at 3 years, 75% at 4 years|\n|Per-issuer cap|$10M|$15M (indexed after 2027)|\n|Gross asset limit|$50M|$75M (indexed after 2027)|\n\nImportant: these new rules only apply to stock acquired after July 4, 2025. Old QSBS is still under the old rules.\n\nThe strategy some people use: sell Bitcoin, invest in qualifying QSBS, hold 3+ years, exit with 50%+ of gains excluded, then roll into new QSBS under Section 1045. It's a way to create compounding tax-free growth that's not available with direct Bitcoin holdings.\n\n**Opportunity Zones.** If you have capital gains from selling Bitcoin, you can defer (and partially reduce) them by putting the proceeds into a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund within 180 days. Hold for 10+ years and the appreciation on the OZ investment is tax-free.\n\nNot simple though—you need an actual qualifying fund and a long time horizon.\n\n**State residency.** Don't forget state taxes.\n\n* **No income tax on wages/investments:** Texas, Florida, Wyoming, Nevada\n* **Washington:** No wage tax, but they do have a capital gains excise tax now—7% up to $1M, 9.9% above that. So it's not \"no tax\" for Bitcoin gains.\n* **High tax states:** California (13.3%), New York, New Jersey\n\nSome people with big unrealized gains move to a no-tax state before selling. But you have to actually move—domicile matters, not just a mailing address. California and New York audit aggressively using \"closer connection\" tests.\n\n**Charitable giving.** If you donate appreciated Bitcoin directly to a charity:\n\n* You get a deduction for the full fair market value\n* You pay zero capital gains tax on the appreciation\n\nThis works best with long-held BTC that's way up. Selling first and donating cash triggers the gain—don't do that.\n\nDonor Advised Funds are useful here. Contribute the Bitcoin, get the deduction now, recommend grants to charities over time.\n\nCharitable Lead Trusts are underused, especially in high-income years. The charity gets paid first for a set term, remainder goes to you or your heirs. If structured right, you get a big deduction now to offset a Bitcoin gain, then pay tax on trust income later. It's a tax-smoothing play.\n\n**Gifting.** A few things to know:\n\n* Annual exclusion: $19,000 per recipient (no gift tax return required)\n* Lifetime exemption: $13.99M individual / $27.98M married for 2025; jumps to $15M / $30M in 2026 under OBBBA\n* Recipient takes your cost basis\n\nThe OBBBA made the higher exemption permanent—no more sunset that would've dropped it back to \\~$7M.\n\n**\"Valuation trough\" gifting:** Bitcoin's volatility is actually useful here. Gift during a market dip and you \"freeze\" the value at a lower point, using less of your lifetime exemption. All the recovery happens outside your estate.\n\n**Puerto Rico (Act 60).** This is the most aggressive move. Relocate to PR, become a bona fide resident, and new capital gains after your move can be taxed at 0%.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Actually live there (183+ days/year)\n* Buy real property within 2 years\n* $10,000+ annual charitable donation (doubled from $5K under old Act 22)\n\nThe trap: there's a 10-year lookback rule under IRC 937(b). If you had built-in gains before you moved, selling within 10 years means those pre-move gains are still U.S.-sourced. Only gains that accrue after you establish residency get the 0% rate.\n\nThe IRS is not messing around here. They launched a task force in 2021, and they've already gotten criminal convictions. In U.S. v. Gajwani (June 2025), a guy pleaded guilty to backdating an S-corp election to hide $30M in gains. He got $15.3M in restitution and a year of probation.\n\nHere's the thing: investors who want Puerto Rico to avoid taxes on frequent trading are usually the worst fit for the strategy. It works best for people who hold long-term and trade rarely. Unless you're willing to sit on your positions for a decade after moving, it probably doesn't help if you already have big gains.\n\n**The Wash Sale Situation**\n\nCurrent law as of December 2025:\n\n* **Spot Bitcoin:** Classified as \"property\"—not subject to wash sale rules\n* **Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, BITO):** Securities—subject to wash sale rules\n\nThis creates an opportunity. You can sell a Bitcoin ETF at a loss, immediately buy spot BTC, and keep your exposure. Since they're different legal categories, the \"substantially identical\" rule doesn't apply.\n\nCaveats:\n\n* The IRS hasn't specifically ruled on cross-asset \"identicality\"\n* \"Substantially identical\" is a facts-and-circumstances test\n* Treasury has proposed extending wash sales to crypto, but Congress hasn't acted\n* This is a reasonable position but not bulletproof\n\nAdvanced version: hold both spot and ETFs. When you rebalance, harvest losses from whichever is down, then immediately buy the other to maintain exposure.\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\nBitcoin tax strategy isn't about \"avoiding taxes.\" It's about:\n\n* Knowing when tax is triggered\n* Deciding where your Bitcoin exposure lives (taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts)\n* Keeping your options open as laws change\n\n**What's different now:**\n\n|Category|Old Way|New Reality|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Broker reporting|Self-reported CSVs|Mandatory 1099-DA|\n|Cost basis|Universal pooling|Per-wallet only|\n|Gift exclusion|$18,000 (2024)|$19,000 (2025/2026)|\n|Solo 401(k) cap|\\~$69,000|$72,000 (2026)|\n|Catch-up rules|All pre-tax OK|High earners must use Roth|\n|QSBS exclusion|5-year minimum|Tiered (50% at 3 years)|\n|Wash sales|Proposed for crypto|No (spot) / Yes (ETFs)|\n\nThe new documentation requirements favor institutions. Custodial services will provide clean basis reporting. Individuals managing multiple wallets face serious reconciliation headaches. The regulatory direction is subtly pushing retail investors toward custodial solutions and away from self-custody.\n\nThe main risk now isn't under-reporting—it's documentation failure. If you can't prove your basis, you could pay tax on 100% of the proceeds.\n\nThe real edge isn't the trade. It's the structure you build around how you hold your assets.\n\n**Questions Worth Asking Yourself**\n\n* What's my actual time horizon with Bitcoin?\n* Am I optimizing for now or for decades from now?\n* Do I have retirement accounts I'm not using efficiently?\n* What state do I live in, and does it matter for my situation?\n* What would it look like if I never sold?\n\nHappy to discuss any of this at a high level. Can't give specific advice in the comments, but I'm always down to talk through concepts.\n\nAnd seriously—donut recommendations welcome.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pti4cb/bitcoin_and_taxes_whats_important_now_what_could/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Metrics like wallet activity, exchange inflows/outflows, and HODLer behavior suggest accumulation is accelerating. For example, the number of addresses holding 1 BTC or more continues to grow steadily, while exchange reserves are declining, indicating that long-term holders are increasingly moving coins off exchanges and out of circulation. At the same time, entities like miners are showing disciplined selling patterns, which historically reduces short-term supply shock risk.\n\nHash rate trends also remain robust, signaling continued network security and miner confidence despite price fluctuations. Combined with growing adoption of Lightning Network channels and Layer-2 activity, these metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s network is becoming both more secure and more liquid for peer-to-peer transfers.

Bitcoin is viewed as a complementary asset that may help offset currency risk, especially after the Brazilian real reached record lows in late 2024.\n\nThe recommendation also highlights regulated exposure through local products like BITI11, a Brazil-listed Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors to gain BTC exposure within a familiar regulatory framework.\n\nThis seems to reflect a broader institutional trend where Bitcoin is increasingly discussed as a small but structured portfolio component, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nCurious how others here view this approach — is a 1%–3% Bitcoin allocation becoming a conservative baseline for institutional portfolios, or does it still feel premature?", "lang": null, "likes": 118, "replies": 17, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ppnrpf/brazils_largest_bank_suggests_a_13_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

For shts &amp; giggles. If Bitcoin runs 30% a year. So i ask Grok. And this what happened. \nWhat Michael Saylor talking about when he say bitcoin going up 30% a year. And how many years is that? If so how much 1 bitcoin will be?\n\nMichael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin advocate, made this statement during a keynote speech at Abu Dhabi Finance Week on December 9, 2025. He was discussing Bitcoin's role as a superior store of value and treasury asset for corporations and nations, countering critics who argue it lacks cash flows by emphasizing how it can generate returns through appreciation and strategic holding. In the speech, he directly said: \"I think Bitcoin is going to go up about 30% a year for the next 20 years.\"\n\nThis is a 20-year projection, taking Bitcoin's value from today out to roughly 2045.\n\nBased on Bitcoin's closing price of about $86,932 on December 17, 2025, a consistent 30% annual compounded growth over 20 years would put 1 BTC at approximately $16.5 million by the end of that period. (This is a straightforward compound growth calculation: Future Value = Present Value × (1 + 0.30)^20. Of course, this is a prediction, not a guarantee—markets are volatile, and past performance doesn't predict the future.)\n\nSo what will 0.1 bitcoin be?\n\nIf Michael Saylor's projection of Bitcoin appreciating at **30% per year** (compounded annually) over the next **20 years** holds true, then:\n\n- 1 BTC would be worth approximately **$16.5 million** in 2045 (as previously calculated, starting from around $87,000 today).\n\n- Therefore, **0.1 BTC** (which is 1/10th of a Bitcoin) would be worth approximately **$1.65 million** in 2045.\n\n### Quick math breakdown:\nThe future value formula is:  \nFuture Value = Present Value × (1 + growth rate)^years  \n\nFor 1 BTC: ~$87,000 × (1.30)^20 ≈ $16,521,395  \n\nFor 0.1 BTC: $16,521,395 × 0.1 = **$1,652,140** (roughly $1.65 million)\n\nAgain, this is purely based on Saylor's speculative 20-year forecast—Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and no one can guarantee future returns. Past performance isn't indicative of future results!\n\nHow much will milk and eggs be?\n\nIf Michael Saylor's **30% annual compounded appreciation** for Bitcoin over the next **20 years** comes true (leading to ~$16.5 million per BTC in 2045), the key question for everyday items like **milk** and **eggs** is: in what terms are we measuring their price?\n\n### Current prices (December 2025, US averages):\n- A **gallon of milk**: around **$4.00–$4.50** (conventional whole milk; organic is higher, often $8–$9).\n- A **dozen large Grade A eggs**: around **$2.00–$3.50** (recent drops after earlier avian flu spikes pushed them much higher).\n\n### In fiat dollars (USD) in 2045:\nAssuming typical long-term US inflation of **~2–3% per year** (current market expectations and projections hover around 2%), prices would rise modestly:\n- Milk: roughly **$6–$10** per gallon.\n- Eggs: roughly **$3–$6** per dozen.\n\n(These are broad estimates—actual prices depend on supply chains, energy costs, regulations, etc.)\n\n### In Bitcoin terms (satoshis or BTC) in 2045:\nThis is where Saylor's bullish vision shines for BTC holders. Bitcoin is designed as a **deflationary asset** (fixed supply of 21 million coins). If its value rises dramatically while fiat inflates (even mildly), goods and services become **much cheaper when priced in Bitcoin**.\n\nUsing the same math:\n- Today's ~$4.20 gallon of milk costs about **~4,800 satoshis** (at BTC ~$87,000).\n- In 2045, at $16.5M per BTC, that same gallon (assuming ~$7 in inflated USD) would cost only **~42 satoshis**—over **100x cheaper** in BTC terms.\n- Eggs would drop from ~3,000–4,000 sats today to **~30–50 sats** per dozen.\n\nIn a \"hyperbitcoinization\" scenario (widespread BTC adoption as Saylor envisions), everyday groceries like milk and eggs would feel **incredibly affordable** to Bitcoin holders—potentially cheaper than they've ever been in sound money terms, thanks to productivity gains and Bitcoin's appreciating purchasing power.\n\nOf course, this is highly speculative. Bitcoin's growth isn't guaranteed, and adoption timelines are uncertain. But in Saylor's projected world, holding BTC makes basics like milk and eggs **way cheaper** over time.\n\n16.5 million in 2045 will feel like what 1 million ?\n\nIn Michael Saylor's hypothetical 2045 scenario (with 1 BTC at ~**$16.5 million**), the question of what that amount of money \"feels like\" in terms of purchasing power boils down to adjusting for expected **USD inflation** over the next 20 years.\n\n### Long-term US inflation context\n- The Federal Reserve targets ~2% annual inflation.\n- Historical long-term average (since 1913) is around 3.1%, but recent decades and current market expectations are closer to **2–2.5%**.\n- Market-based forecasts (e.g., Cleveland Fed models, breakeven rates) suggest around **2.5%** average over long horizons like 20–30 years.\n\n### Purchasing power calculation\nUsing a conservative **2.5%** annual inflation rate (compounded):\n\n- Prices in 2045 will be about **1.64 times** higher than today.\n- Therefore, **$16.5 million in 2045 dollars** would have the same purchasing power as roughly **$10 million** in today's (2025) dollars.\n\n(Quick math: Future value factor = (1 + 0.025)^20 ≈ 1.64  \nPresent equivalent = $16,521,395 / 1.64 ≈ **$10.07 million** today.)\n\n### Range of estimates\nIf we use different rates:\n- At **2%** inflation (Fed target): ~**$11.1 million** today.\n- At **3%** (closer to historical average): ~**$9.1 million** today.\n\nSo, in a realistic scenario, **$16.5 million in 2045** would feel like **$9–11 million** in current money—truly life-changing wealth, enough for multiple luxury homes, private jets, or generational financial security.\n\n### Tie-back to everyday items\nAs we discussed earlier with milk (~$4/gallon today) and eggs (~$2–3/dozen today, after recent drops):\n- In 2045 fiat dollars, they'd cost maybe $6–7 for milk and $4–5 for eggs (at 2.5% inflation).\n- But to a Bitcoin holder with that appreciated wealth, they'd still feel trivially cheap—like pennies today.\n\nThis is the core of Saylor's argument: Bitcoin's projected appreciation could massively outpace fiat inflation, dramatically increasing your real-world buying power over time. Of course, it's a bold forecast—actual outcomes depend on adoption, regulation, and macro factors.\n\nU.S. national averages as of late 2025, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and USDA reports.\n\nSo… how many sats for a dozen eggs in 2045? 🥚😏\"\nor\n\"Still think holding fiat is smart? 🤔\"", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pp0bdo/i_was_just_got_finish_listening_to_mike_talks_for/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

I’ve been investing heavily in Bitcoin since I was 20 while working a well-paying corporate 9–5. At this point, roughly \\~**75% of my net worth is in BTC**, about **20% in 401k / IRA**, and the rest is in **cash for emergencies / liquidity** (even though I don’t love holding fiat… but we still live in a fiat world).\n\nI fully believe in Bitcoin long-term and plan to keep stacking regardless of price.

But right now, in my 20s, it feels more like I’m hoarding something incredibly valuable without a clear plan for translating it into a life.\n\nI’m NOT bearish, not doubting Bitcoin — just trying to hear how others with similar exposure are thinking about the future. **What’s your plan?**\n\nWould really appreciate hearing different perspectives even if you aren't in your mid 20s and if you're older what would you tell your younger self.

So theoretically, lets say you have an LLC and pay your taxes at tax time April of the following year.  You could DCA each week into bitcoin rather than setting aside cash for taxes, and although you could be in the hole, you could also be up depending on the increase in bitcoins price that year.

That alone raises several questions.\n\nFirst: how does someone with such an extraordinary understanding of cryptography, incentives, and attack surfaces make such a basic operational-security mistake? Letting an email account go inactive for years while it contains historically sensitive communication is an enormous risk. Forgetfulness seems unlikely at that level.\n\nSecond: why GMX in the first place? Even by the standards of the late 2000s, GMX was not known for strong security or privacy guarantees. Choosing one of the weakest mainstream email providers feels inconsistent with the mindset that designed Bitcoin.\n\nThird: why didn’t this become a much bigger issue from a law-enforcement or intelligence standpoint? If anyone could theoretically identify Satoshi, it would be the email provider — via login records, IP addresses, timestamps, or metadata. Why was GMX never forced, publicly or quietly, to hand over everything they had? Or were they?\n\nFourth: how was it possible to run BitcoinTalk, register domains, and host infrastructure without the registrar or hosting provider being able to tie this back to a real identity? Either the OPSEC was near-perfect in some areas — or imperfect in others, which again feels contradictory.\n\nAnd finally, the coins. Roughly 1.1 million BTC (give or take) have never moved. Why? This isn’t about price — Bitcoin’s fundamentals wouldn’t change — but from a market-psychology perspective, Satoshi could trigger massive panic among weak hands at any time. The fact that this never happened is, in itself, one of the strongest signals we have.\n\nNone of this is meant to undermine Bitcoin. Quite the opposite. I’m genuinely curious how people here reconcile these inconsistencies. Are we overestimating Satoshi’s OPSEC? Or underestimating how much was intentionally left behind?\n\nWould love to hear thoughtful takes — not myths or hero worship, but grounded explanations.", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 12, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pn3vfj/revisiting_satoshi_nakamoto_opsec_gmx_and_the/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Every ten minutes the system randomly selects one winning field on a grid of unimaginable size. Players use real electricity and buy specialized machines to guess as many fields as fast as possible. The first player to hit the winning field gets points written into a public scoreboard.\n\n\n\nCrucially, every winning guess is sealed with an enormous amount of computational work. This makes it practically impossible to go back and rewrite past scoreboard entries without redoing all the work from that point forward, faster than the rest of the network combined. This costly proof is marketed as the game’s killer feature: the scoreboard is now “immutable” and “ultra-secure.” No one can steal or erase your points without spending insane amounts of energy.\n\nJohn hits the winning field and gets 1 point written into the scoreboard. Alice runs five times as much hardware and gets 5 points. The points are simply the result of who expended more energy.\n\nNow Steve comes along and pays 100 000 dollars to have John’s point transferred to him on the scoreboard while John’s score is reset to zero.\n\nQuestion: did Steve invest? Did John and Alice create tokens, money, or assets? No, it is absurd to even ask.\n\nThis is exactly how Bitcoin works. Instead of guessing fields, players (incorrectly called miners) try to guess the hash number that the network has set as the target. The first to guess it gets point (BTC) written into the public scoreboard (the blockchain). Every new block is sealed with the same enormous computational proof that makes rewriting history astronomically expensive. This proof is marketed as Bitcoin’s main value proposition: your points are “seizure-resistant digital property.”\n\nBut here is the crucial point: this has nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy. Let us explain why.\n\nInvesting presupposes the existence of a resource that generates a return.\n\nWith stocks, there is a company with economic activity. The number 100 is not points but a measure of the size of your share in that company. The return in the form of dividends, buybacks, or liquidation proceeds comes from that resource. A higher number means you are entitled to a higher return.\n\nThe dollar is a more complex type of investment where the resource is debt. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of thin air. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and machines and produces, for example, a car. You buy the car and pay in dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives those dollars, it simply deletes them from its balance sheet and they disappear. You received a car, and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished. The return in the form of the car came from the company that owed the bank.\n\nAnother example: you pay taxes to the state in dollars. The state uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are deleted from the Fed’s balance sheet and disappear from the market. You received a service (your tax obligation was erased and you are not going to jail). That return again came from the debtor, this time the state.\n\nSo the numbers in the above cases quantify the share in resources (company and debt) that generate returns. Bitcoin is not issued as a share in a company or as someone’s debt, so there is no resource generating a return for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin is literally issued only as a point in a guessing game, and the only thing being secured by all the expensive proof is the point table itself.\n\nThese points are also not tokens, money, or assets, because all such things involve some obligation, physical substance, or digital content.\n\nA token represents an obligation of the issuer: 100 on a casino chip or gift card means the issuer owes money or goods, and a larger number means a larger obligation. With physical substances such as grain, metal, or oil, and with digital ones such as MP3s, videos, e-books, or apps, a larger number means you hold more mass, more volume, or more digital content.\n\nIf John has 100 BTC and Alice has 1 BTC, that does not mean the issuer owes John a hundred times more money or goods. It does not mean John holds a hundred times more physical material or digital files. It only means he has a larger number on the scoreboard. Just as there is no resource to invest in, there’s no substance to be a token, money, or an asset.\n\nThe expensive proof does not change anything fundamental: the only thing being secured is the scoreboard itself, and the only reason miners keep producing that proof is that the points on the scoreboard still command a price. When that price collapses far enough, miners turn off their machines, the security collapses with it, and the ultra-secure points instantly become trivially rewriteable points again.\n\nIt is funny (and a little sad) how many people do not realize that Bitcoin is just a giant, energy-intensive, self-referential guessing game in which participants bet that someone will keep paying to maintain the illusion that meaningless points are valuable because they are “secure,” and they are “secure” only as long as people keep paying for them.\n\nThe whole thing remains technological nonsense and has literally nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pkm4zg/bitcoin_as_technological_nonsense_a_pointless/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Lost interest in 2014. Picked it back up in 2017 and have mined and also purchased significantly since then. \n\nI don't wish to say how much I was sitting at as of 2023, but let's just say I was in what many would consider a small group in terms of my holdings. \n\nIn 2023 I had a significant life disrupting event and after wiping out over $50k in savings had no choice but to liquidate a little less than half my BTC holding. I got rid of everything else first, savings, vehicles, other crypto such as DOGE, XRP, Litecoin etc until I had nothing left to liquidate but BTC. \n\n2023 was rough; my 780+ credit score was destroyed, dropped into the 400s. It was bad. \n\n2024 was very much survival mode and then towards July of this year (2025) I finally recovered enough to start buying BTC again. Just little bits here and there. But then this current dip happened and I am like holy shit this is too good to be true. \n\nI have purchased 0.2 and counting so far in the current dip and while I still have along way to go to get back to where I was (probably won't ever be able to once the price starts spiking again), at least it's a start. \n\nLiterally been putting every spare cent in. $50 here. $100 there. Every. Satoshi. Counts. Right? Especially when we all know where BTC is going. \n\nIts so crazy to me that in 2012 when I started this journey no one ever thought BTC would go anywhere. The road from $100 to $100k has been insane and yet we all know it's just the start. 10 years from now I fully expect BTC will have flown past 1 million and probably somewhere in the 2 to 3m range or more. \n\nThat's why I keep telling everyone.

Bitcoin made a new ATH in October (~$126k), but by December we’re back near $90k, which puts BTC red YTD.

I'm a college student currently and I do have BTC. I'm not someone who has that much money to spend, but I do have some, and this is not a way to antagonize. It's a clear headed way of looking at it, hopefully.\n\nBitcoin is a bet on demand and adoption, isn't it? It's what I think. Do it irresponsibly and you might even call it a gamble. Its true, as money it's bad (at its current state, I think you all know why). As a hedge against inflation? It's been here for 16 years with no concise way of knowing it'll stay or keep its performance. Intrinsically, its backed by speculators (my opinion).\n\nIt's a bet that enough people believe it'll go up, that is, more people will also believe it as a way to increase their money. If enough people believe it for long enough, it may get a little bit of a normative position in society's view of finance. But that's only \"if\". If enough believe in it, it might stay valuable. \"If\". Eventually with increased marketcap, it'll be harder to make money there and then it'd be like, well, an alternative to gold, really. Or, the cycle could become the norm and it'd be an asset where people gamble for periods of times.\n\nBitcoin is a gambled speculative allocation based on long term belief adoption. And your allocation probably should be how comfortable you are with that, 1-5% probably (Consider enough exposure if it succeeds, while not enough pain if it fails). It's a bet on adoption and demand, some people want that bet, some don't. Bitcoin is not guaranteed, not inevitable, not backed by fundamentals, not a proven hedge, not money today. Again, it's a bet on adoption and demand (some people want that bet, some don't.)\n\nThank you and do engage if you say there's an aspect missed so that others consider it.\n\nI made a recent post in the most bearish sub for bitcoin (you know which sub), and they should have pointers to consider on why bitcoin adoption and demand making it into a financial norm in some way or niche has difficulties.\n\nedit: typo", "lang": null, "likes": 7, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pk97xg/a_view_on_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "Bitcoin"}

Spot XRP exchange-held reserves have fallen sharply, with estimates suggesting only around 1.5 billion XRP remain on trading platforms as of late December 2025. \n\nKey Insights\nSupply Dynamics: The supply of XRP on centralized exchanges has contracted significantly, a trend widely interpreted as a sign of institutional accumulation and long-term holding rather than active trading. Over $1.32 billion in XRP has left exchanges in one recent 30-day period alone.\nETF Performance: Spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. have attracted over $1.14 billion in cumulative net inflows since their launch in mid-November 2025, with several products recording continuous daily inflows. This contrasts with outflows seen in some Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs during the same period, suggesting a potential decoupling of XRP from broader market trends.\nMarket Sentiment: While consistent institutional inflows point to long-term confidence, the price has remained in a range-bound, weak pattern, leading some analysts to note a divergence between on-chain data and price action.\nPotential for Supply Shock: Analysts suggest that this imbalance between strong, persistent demand from ETFs and the rapidly decreasing supply on exchanges could lead to a significant supply shock by early 2026, potentially driving a major price movement if retail demand increases.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pz3k0q/day_of_recogning/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

EVM in two weeks. \n**Dusk (DUSK) quick summary — what they’re trying to accomplish (and why anyone should care)**\n\nDusk is building a **privacy-first, compliance-friendly L1** aimed at **regulated finance / RWAs** — basically: bring real-world financial instruments on-chain while keeping sensitive data confidential *and* still workable for institutions.\n\n**Core thesis**\n\n* Most chains are either “fully transparent DeFi” or “privacy at all costs.”\n* Dusk is trying to be **confidential + auditable + regulator-compatible** for things like securities issuance, trading, settlement, and compliant DeFi. ([dusk.network][1])\n\n**How they’re doing it (architecture)**\nDusk is moving to a **3-layer modular stack**:\n\n* **DuskDS** = consensus / data availability / settlement layer (foundation)\n* **DuskEVM** = EVM execution layer (Solidity + normal Ethereum tooling)\n* **DuskVM** = future privacy-focused VM layer (for heavier privacy apps) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\n**Why the EVM layer matters**\nDuskEVM is meant to reduce friction so devs can use **Hardhat/Foundry** and deploy Solidity contracts like on any EVM chain, while still settling to DuskDS. ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\nNotable quirks from their docs:\n\n* DuskEVM currently inherits a **“7-day finalization period”** (their wording) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n* **No public mempool** (transactions are only visible to the sequencer right now) ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n* Docs list **Mainnet chain ID 744** + official RPC/explorer URLs (and note mainnet “Live: No” while testnet is live). ([DOCUMENTATION][2])\n\n**Institution angle / regulated rails**\nDusk is leaning hard into the “regulated edge” narrative via **NPEX** (a licensed Dutch trading venue), claiming it brings a suite of licenses into the stack and helps enable regulated issuance/trading/settlement. ([dusk.network][1])\nThey’ve also pushed interoperability/market-data standards via **Chainlink + NPEX** for regulated assets on-chain. ([PR Newswire][3])\nAnd there’s reporting on 21X (DLT Pilot Regime venue) collaborating with Dusk, with Dusk onboarding initially as a trade participant. ([Ledger Insights][4])\n\n**Timeline / catalyst**\n\n* Dusk shipped a **DuskDS L1 upgrade on Dec 10, 2025**, framed as the “final release before DuskEVM mainnet.” ([tradingview.com][5])\n* **EVM mainnet launch:** community/team chatter in Discord suggests it was “this month” then slipped **~2 weeks**. I *can’t* find a public dated announcement to cite, so treat the “two weeks” as **target/estimate**, not a guarantee.\n\n**TL;DR**\nDusk is trying to be **the chain for compliant, privacy-preserving financial markets**, using a modular stack where **EVM is the “easy dev onboarding” layer** and privacy/compliance is the differentiator.

Also, our own relationship with scarcity and its psychology. \n\nI preface this by saying there is no such thing as a perfect financial system at this juncture, the best hope is for more forward thinking humans that care deeply about sustainable futures, while also being wise about innovation and novelty.\n\nWith that said...\n\nI thought about the best metaphor that I can think of to get a sense of my current perspective.\n\nLets use sports and trading cards/jerseys. (I leaned towards using Michael Jordan as a metaphor, but I think Tom Brady fits better.)\n\nLets say that the National Footbal League underwent a massive scandal and lost much of its popularity and trust/viewership. The salary cap was becoming unsustainable to pay the star players and the demand was very uneven.\n\nTom Brady comes out of obscurity as a 6th round pick... Essentially undrafted for all intents and purposes of this example.\nThe NFL instituted that to draw more fans and network effect, they will be taking a game jersey for every player and will make tiny square patches to distribute in a limited supply trading card.\n\nTom Brady's patch is worth less than a penny to start.\nThe star player from the Patriots goes out with a near season ending injury and Tom gets his chance to start.\nSlowly, his patch value goes up as he performs well and builds a network effect of fans.\n\nHe becomes a super bowl winner and his patch value skyrockets... It even becomes very speculative in the \"ceiling\" of its value. His patch value crashes a good amount because of the off-season and people lost interest in football.\n\nAs football season starts, more activity on his jersey patches raise the value of each patch. Very early on the price action is very volatile (but trends up overall due to interest) because we are not sure about if he can sustain his own performance. I.E. injury/computer hacks, swan events, something better (like ethereum) comes out where the QB is more mobile... Think Vince Young, Michael Vick, etc.\n\nYet the same rule applies. Only a limited amount of game jerseys will ever be produced. Those who got the earliest game jerseys have the biggest \"fan  network effect.\"\n\nWhen it gets really speculative, they can simply cut up a piece of a patch even more... Down to its smallest unit and call it a Brady (Satoshi) so that everyone can own a piece of Tom Brady.\n\nAs we know, Tom Brady played for many many years and was very successful (perhaps the greatest QB of all time). There are no more Tom Brady Jersey's being produced.\n\nFootball continues (money printing/Traditional currency). Tom Brady is still going quite strong at peak interests because he is the GOAT of football. \n\nBut eventually, his name will lose steam over time as the \"show\" goes on. He may very well still hold a good amount of value as his name will still hold a prominence (just like stars from older generations and their value). \n\nBut, to say... Every player will be pegged to Tom Brady for its value is not the best system going forward because Tom Brady was not the NFL. \n\nThe NFL enabled Tom Brady to gain prominence. People love Tom Brady so much (The biggest fans who got in early) that they try to build a narrative that the NFL should change its name to the TBFL (Tom Brady Football League) and as a nice little fun coincidence, his last Super Bowl win was with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His legacy is now even more cemented for the naysayers of his greatness.\n\nAfter his retirement from football, jerseys are still being produced, new players and even more fun and vibrant colors and logos are being created to fit the time and to keep the interest in the league.\n\nTom Brady didnt fail, he was awesome and great for his time... Perhaps needed to help gain more trust in the system again, and to have the system become more creative in keeping \"interest\" in the league. \n\nBut to say his name and likeness should replace the league all together would not be wise at all. \n\nHe can no longer play at his level and sustain performance and interest for the League as a whole... He would also suppress the value for new players and their performance because everything is pegged to him.\n\nHe is still remembered, and his scarce Jersey's are highly valuable, but they do not comprise the value of the entire NFL.\n\nMore \"Value\" will always be generated in the League and new ways and players to sustain performance.\n\nNew fans will not care as much about Tom Brady because he was from a different Era. \n\nThere are also no more of his patches that they can easily get at a meaningful level because all of the patches have already been distributed.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 23, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pw97eg/my_personal_view_on_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

And how does Ethereum address this? ####**Is Decentralization merely a buzz word and a means to an end?**\n\nUltimately, everyone wants:\n\n1. **Availability and fault tolerance**: The blockchain continues running even when some nodes are unavailable.\n2. **Safety**: Network operators can't seize or use assets without permission.\n3. **Censorship-resistance**: Network operators can't censor valid transactions.\n4. **Transparency/auditing**: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger and verifiable through permissionless nodes.\n\n####**Full decentralization isn't necessary to obtain these security properties.**\n\nThere is no blockchain that exists today with full decentralization. Fortunately, there are ways to acquire security through **protocol design** without needing full decentralization. Features like L2 exit hatches and recovery through a proof system provide anti-censorship properties regardless of whether the L2 network is centralized. \n\nOther designs like Attestor-Proposer-Builder Separation create a separation of powers where the builder can be centralized, but overall block production is decentralized due to proposers and attestors being decentralized. (This is the opposite of proof-of-work where a miner is single-handedly responsible for building, validating, and proposing the block.)\n\nIf decentralization were absolutely important, we wouldn't be using mining pools, staking pools, CEXs, L2 networks, and wallets that rely on RPCs. The Nakamoto Coefficient measures the number of bad entities it takes to compromise a network. If decentralization were absolutely important, we'd be avoiding networks with low Nakamoto Coefficients like Bitcoin and Ethereum. And we'd be avoiding networks with low client diversity, or with high miner/validator hardware requirements.\n\n####**How does Ethereum addresses security?**\n\nDespite having a low Nakamoto Coefficient, Ethereum fundamentally still has all the benefits of decentralization because it is designed with:\n\n* **Very high economic security and safety** from Proof-of-stake. Aligned economic interests where the people holding the token are incentivized to protect it. Cannot be attacked by miners without economic stake.\n* **Very high client diversity** with 10+ independent client dev teams to allow for fault tolerance and high decentralized governance\n* **Deterring malicious actors** by slashing validators who act badly. This increases economic security.\n* **Providing Economic finality** through its Casper-CBC finality gadget, which also prevents long-range attacks and deep reorgs\n* **Providing sustainable security budget** through EIP-1559 and validator rewards to support network security indefinitely\n* **Attestor-Proposer-Builder Separation**: Ethereum builders are centralized. However, that doesn't matter since there is attestor-proposer-builder separation where the builders are separated from the nodes proposing the blocks, which are also different from the nodes validating the blocks. This separation will be further enshrined in the upcoming Glamsterdam update.\n* **Layer 2 rollups at Stage 1-2 inherit the security of L1** despite having centralized sequencers because honest transactions can be forced, and dishonest transactions can be economically-reversed through proof mechanisms even without the support of the centralized sequencer.\n\n####**How does Bitcoin addresses security?**\n\nAnd despite having a low Nakamoto Coefficient, Bitcoin has ... umm ... none of these.... Sorry, never mind.\n\nI'm sure the adoption of Stratum v2 miner-submitted block templates will eventually pick up by the year 2050.\n\nAnd we can only hope they figure out a sustainable security budget protocol.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1puut50/is_decentralization_merely_a_means_to_an_end_and/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

One trader shared how they were trading UXLINK on Bitget during the Crazy 48H, and managed to earn, despite Bitcoin’s sideways action. It’s a reminder that while BTC sets the tone, there are other ways to stay active and profitable in the market.\n\nLooking ahead, the key factors to watch are whether liquidity returns, funding rates normalize, and macro sentiment eases.

Making it a legit business so I could expense &amp; capitalize stuff. Watching endless youtube videos on the best gpu builds.  My first wooden gpu frame (still have it),  buying the 12 bay octominers, buying bitcoin miners,  upgrading my electrical panel to run them.    Buying Kaspa miners  (my by far largest crypto loss)  And now... dusty used equipment that I've  been meaning to clean up and sell for ages but never quite seem to have enough time to get around to doing.\n\nNowadays I have automatic dca set up for Bitcoin and Eth again. Lol,  like the old days  but a lot more convenient.   (Who else remembers buying Bitcoin on Ebay way way way back?  #regrets for losing that wallet key).    \n\nI look  back at it,  the hours spent, the interactions with the crytpo community, the profit (of course) ,  and  I smile.  It was a really good time in my life.  Things change and times moves on, but that cycle will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nAll but one of my shitcoins are gone now  (most gone to zero or lost on Tradeogre and Xeggex).   Lol,  the sole survivor shitcoin - TCG World.    I checked in on their Telegram recently.  Looks like their crypto based game is close the being a closed alpha? Beta?  I'll give them this , they had a vision and are sticking with it.  Maybe if I hold it for another 4 years I'll break even on it :D\n\nDid I get rich off crypto?   Nope.  It's going to sound super cliche, but the real reward was the journey and friends made along the way.

It’s end of 2025, and “altseason” has quietly been pushed from 2024 to 2025 to now maybe 2026. What’s changed isn’t timing, it’s belief. Fewer people actually think it’s coming anymore.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality is that altcoins used to rally on new buyers. That buyer base is basically gone. Crypto Twitter, maybe \\~50k people, already owns altcoins. These are cycle veterans, already exposed, already burned, already allocated. There’s no fresh capital here to move markets.\n\nRetail is fragmented and underfunded. The only entities that can actually move prices are funds, institutions, and wealthy allocators. They draw the chart. And they are not buying altcoins.\n\nWhy? Because most altcoins don’t represent ownership.\n\nGovernance tokens especially have been exposed over the past year. On paper, token holders vote. In practice, turnout is tiny, execution is optional, and core teams or foundations retain override powers under “security” or “urgency.” When votes conflict with insider preferences, outcomes get delayed, reframed, or bypassed. Over time, rational holders stop participating. Governance turns into theater.\n\nSky(MakerDao) is a good example. Votes happened. Debates happened. And yet major decisions were effectively decided elsewhere. Participation collapsed once it became clear votes didn’t constrain outcomes.\n\nEven if governance worked perfectly, it still wouldn’t solve the core issue: institutions don’t buy voting rights. They buy ownership.\n\nThis leads to the deeper structural flaw: the DAO vs devco split. Tokens live in DAOs. Teams, IP, trademarks, and execution live in labs companies. When acquisitions happen, buyers acquire the devco, not the DAO. The token isn’t bought. Holders don’t benefit. We’ve seen this repeatedly with Tensor, Padre, Axelar, and others.\n\nThe people and IP move on. The token is left governing an empty shell.\n\nThis problem even applies to Ethereum. ETH is a utility token, not ownership. It doesn’t guarantee cash flows, equity, or control. Its valuation depends on demand and relevance, not rights. And relevance is fragile in a world of L2s, fee compression, and improving tech.\n\nInstitutions aren’t avoiding altcoins because they “don’t get crypto.” They’re avoiding them because there’s nothing to own.\n\nUntil tokens represent real ownership, enforceable rights, or cash flows, altcoin season probably stays a meme. Fixing that likely means regulation, securities, and a very different crypto culture.\n\nAnd that’s the real tradeoff no one wants to talk about.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nSince this post got some attention, I made a YouTube video about it: [https://youtu.be/igwZzJuZWNw](https://youtu.be/igwZzJuZWNw)", "lang": null, "likes": 300, "replies": 251, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pr0d56/altseason_is_canceled_forever/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.", "lang": null, "likes": 248, "replies": 58, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pq29wl/vitalik_buterin_warns_elon_musk_that_xs_hate/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Every time the market pulls back, the sentiment flips instantly. People start talking like the entire industry has stalled out.. meanwhile, in the background, adoption is accelerating faster than ever. It's almost comical how disconnected price and reality can be in this space.\n\nLook around: governments are openly discussing Bitcoin strategy, Japan is lowering crypto taxes, stablecoins are basically the default remittance rail in half of LATAM, tokenization is becoming an actual banking product, and institutions keep building even if they're not shouting about it. None of that looks like an industry losing momentum.\n\nAnd the mainstream spillover is getting harder to ignore. Sports, entertainment, retail - all of it is slowly tying itself into crypto infrastructure. A good example is how several digital-asset companies have landed major partnerships this year. Nexo showing up as the crypto partner for the Australian Open (and other big sporting events earlier in the year) is the kind of thing you wouldn't have seen during past downturns. You don't get that level of visibility unless the industry is moving into the normal part of life category.\n\nThat's why I find the current doom-and-gloom narratives funny. Prices dip - they always do - but the underlying adoption curve hasn't slowed at all. If anything, the pace of real-world integration is faster now than when the market was euphoric. Historically, this is the phase where people hesitate... then look back two years later and wonder why they ignored all the obvious signals.\n\nAnd honestly, at some point the pattern becomes impossible to ignore. Every dip gets framed as \"the end\" and every time the world just absorbs more crypto into daily life. You can only watch governments weaken their currencies, watch institutions move on-chain, watch real-world businesses adopt this stuff and watch global events partner with crypto companies for so long before the picture becomes obvious.\n\nPeople get scared by the short-term noise, but the long-term trend feels almost baked into the structure now. Maybe the real risk isn't the downturns - maybe it's assuming these moments will always last. Because if crypto really does keep sliding into the role fiat used to play, then hesitating at the lows will look a lot different in hindsight than it does in the moment.\n\nTake the headlines how you want, but the direction of travel seems pretty clear.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 0, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pp2yn4/looks_like_crypto_repeats_the_same_cycle_price/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Gaining consensus is priority number one. That is hard because OGs don't like the term \"freeze.\" The proposal isn't writing rules to freeze particular keys, it is preventing use of signatures that are unsecure. So all holders would be given time to transition to private keys that are secure against post quantum capabilities.  I think Lopp frames the right questions and counterpoints. \n\nI've raised my thoughts on this as well and posted some ideas on how to transition.  I actually agree it doesn't make sense to leave open a method where quantum computing can steal keys.\n\nClosing that gap may come at the expense of some that fail to ever transition, but if they've been given years to transition, there isn't a strong argument that it isn't fair.  Securing the chain needs to happen.\n\nI've followed the quantum resistant coin category for a long time as a holder of Qanplatform.\n\nWhile many of the projects in the space talk about how they hope to capitalize from users seeking assets already prepared, I still view that as a long shot play.  Which is why most have moved toward building utilty chains. \n\nI think there is a large market incoming as all systems will be making upgrades.  Combining cryptography transition methods and blockchain utility will offer solutions enterprises want.  And they don't have the same decentralized challenges to overcome.  They can start implementing now, and we are seeing that happen.\n\nGlad to see the shift where nearly all coins are working on their approach.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1poi6e5", "author": "JustinCPA", "handle": "JustinCPA", "created_utc": 1765930592.0, "text": "Tax loss harvesting [serious] ***Disclaimer: Educational purposes only. Not tax advice. Talk to your own tax professional about your specific situation. Specific to the USA.***\n\nYear-end is approaching and the window to make powerful tax plays for the 2025 tax year is closing fast.\n\nI’m a CPA with a deep background in crypto tax (formerly helped build a client-facing crypto service firm as GM, now leveraging that experience to build robust crypto tax software as Product Lead at Summ (formerly Crypto Tax Calculator)).\n\nI see the same confusion every year, so I wanted to share some high-level, educational context around tax loss harvesting that may be useful as people review their 2025 activity.\n\n# What is Tax Loss Harvesting?\n\nTax loss harvesting is the act of intentionally selling an asset that has gone down in value from your initial purchase in order to \"realize\" the loss for tax purposes.\n\nBy selling/swapping at a loss (as opposed to simply holding), you trigger a tax loss that can be used to directly offset any capital gains, or even ordinary income (up to $3k, the rest is carried forward).\n\nThe key point: losses don’t exist for tax purposes until they’re realized. Simply holding an underwater asset doesn’t create a deductible loss.\n\n***How does it work?***\n\nA simplified example:\n\nIf that losing position is disposed of before year-end, the loss can reduce the net taxable capital gain. If it isn’t, the unrealized loss provides no tax benefit that year.\n\nI see a lot of traders hold onto losers “just in case,” then get surprised by a larger-than-expected tax bill because those losses were never realized.\n\n*PS -- dead memecoins and NFTs are a tax loss harvesting goldmine.*\n\nSimply put, if I have a $50,000 capital gain from selling ETH at profit (or any crypto, stock, or real estate), but am sitting on a $22,000 unrealized loss from a bad memecoin trade, I could dispose of that asset to reduce my taxable capital gains from $50,000 --&gt; $28,000.\n\n*The catch?*\n\nThis disposal needs to happen **BEFORE YEAR END** in order for it to count for your next tax return.\n\n# Why is this current market a particularly good opportunity (and risk)?\n\nIn general, the crypto market has seen a significant increase in value throughout 2025. Bitcoin has climbed 30+% at times, ETH climbing over 150%+ at times etc.\n\nEach crypto-to-crypto swap is taxable. And in rising market, without realizing it, many people have likely triggered taxable gains as they swapped crypto throughout the year.\n\nBut here at year end, markets are generally down from the highs we saw just a few months ago ($125k BTC --&gt; $90k).\n\nThis means that many people are likely sitting on ***unrealized*** losses while simultaneously sitting on capital gains they will need to pay tax on.\n\nI've seen this trope far too many times.\n\n\\--&gt; Flip gains throughout the year\n\n\\--&gt; positions are underwater by year end\n\n\\--&gt; but they still owe the full amount of tax on the gains because they never realized their losses.\n\nFor those who are prepared, this is a *golden opportunity* to pull this lever and directly reduce their tax bill. For those unprepared, they'll be paying far more tax than they need to all because they failed to properly tax plan and consider end-of-year tax strategy.\n\n# Can I rebuy after I sell?\n\nThe short answer is, yes, you can rebuy. This question stems from the fact that with securities, the \"wash sale rule\" requires you wait 30 days before you can rebuy, otherwise, the loss doesn't count. However, with crypto, this is not the case.\n\nThe IRS classifies crypto as property, not a security, see [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). The wash loss sale rule specifically applies only to securities, not property, see [here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/glossary.jsp?term=wash%20sale). Thus, wash loss sale rule is not applicable for crypto (yet).\n\nThis means you could sell your crypto that's underwater, and then decide to rebuy the same crypto without needing to wait the full 30 days.\n\nIn other words, going to my prior example, someone could sell their losing assets and realize the $22,000 loss, and then later rebuy the same amount of those assets back. The end result? They still realize the loss, and still hold the assets in hopes they go back up.\n\n**There is a caveat here**: While the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto, the \"Economic Substance Doctrine\" does.\n\n**What is the Economic Substance Doctrine (\"ESD\")?**\n\nThe ESD is the IRS's magic wand they can waive to disallow a loss they deem to \"not have economic substance\". In other words, if you're in an audit and the IRS determines a loss is a result of a transaction that did not have any economic substance (ie selling and rebuying *immediately* for the SOLE purpose of finessing a tax loss), then they *might* disallow the loss.\n\nThis means it is best practice to make these transactions with additional goals in mind. e.g., maybe you'd like to rebalance your portfolio so you sell down your losing positions to stop the bleeding and then independently decide which assets you'd like to be exposed to moving forward.\n\nThe takeaway here is that while the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto, that doesn't mean the IRS can't disallow the loss if they determine the transaction didn't have economic substance.\n\n# What is the best way to know which of my assets to sell?\n\nTo evaluate harvesting opportunities, you'll need your detailed transaction history and cost basis by lot (not average)\n\nFor the insane people out there, some do this by Excel. Jokes aside, this is a feasible option for anyone who has fairly simple activity such as just a few trades a year on a single exchange.\n\nFor those who want a more automated process or have a more complicated transaction history (multiple exchanges/wallets, more than a dozen trades a year etc), most rely on a crypto tax calculator. Coming from the service-provider space, we only used software as excel just doesn't cut it in most cases.\n\nFor software, there are a few options out there to chose from, but I personally use Summ for mine (obviously!). That said, I always recommend trying a few and seeing which works best for you. Don't just pick one because someone online likes it, try em out yourself!\n\n***Determining opportunities:***\n\nOnce you've loaded your data into your software of choice, make sure you're transaction history looks complete and accurate. If the software offers a tax loss harvesting feature, then you can use that for your investigation. But if your software doesn't offer that feature, one super easy way to do some testing is to simply create manual transactions *simulating* sales to see what the tax impact is. From here, you can dig even deeper by looking at the tax lots being disposed.\n\nFor example, maybe I simulate the sale of 1 BTC and it comes back with an ***overall*** $2k loss. But, I can drill down even further.\n\nWhen I look at the tax lots being disposed, I can see that the 1 BTC sale might be made up of 3 different tax lots. Maybe two of them are resulting in a loss of $1,500 and $4,500 respectively, and the third tax lot is resulting in a gain of $4,000, making the overall sale a $2,000 net loss.\n\nWith this info, now I know I don't need to sell the whole 1 BTC, but instead can just sell the partial amounts that makes up the two tax lots that would result in a total of $6,000 loss, which is even more powerful then selling the full 1 BTC.\n\nBy doing this, I am only selling the BTC tax lots that result in a loss while leaving the tax lot with an unrealized gain in place.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAs a CPA, I am CONSTANTLY asked how to reduce tax. This is truly one of the most powerful levers a taxpayer can pull in order to reduce their bill to Uncle Sam.\n\nIf anyone has any questions or commentary on the topic, feel free to drop them below. Per usual, always consult with your own tax professional for tax advice specific to you. Cheers, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!\n\n\\- JustinCPA, Product Lead @ Summ", "lang": null, "likes": 31, "replies": 22, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1poi6e5/tax_loss_harvesting_serious/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Powell’s basically saying the Fed is “well positioned to wait and see” and that policy should help the labor market stabilize...he even said it might only tick up one or two more tenths rather than roll over hard. Also important: he said they haven’t made any decision about January.\n\nThe interesting part here is futures markets briefly priced in about a 31% chance of a January cut after the jobs data (then it cooled a bit). Looking further out, the market is still leaning toward roughly two cuts during 2026.\n\nFor crypto this is kinda mixed signals. Lower rates usually mean more money flowing into riskier assets like Bitcoin and ETH because traditional savings become less attractive. But if the Fed stays cautious and keeps rates higher for longer, that could keep pressure on crypto prices in the short term.\n\nETH is currently trading around $2.93k and crypto hasn’t really reacted much even after last week’s 0.25% Fed cut.

I think a lot of people are still sleeping on what's happening with crypto in LATAM - especially Buenos Aires.\n\nIf you actually follow the scene there, it has become insanely active in 2025. Buenos Aires hosted Devconnect Argentina in November 2025, billed as an \"Ethereum World's Fair\" with thousands of builders, creators and devs flying in from around the world. That basically turned the city into a global hub for real crypto development and collaboration, not just another conference stop.\n\nBefore that, Merge Buenos Aires ran in March 2025, bringing together Web3 leaders and communities from Europe and the Americas for panels, talks and networking. And earlier before that, the Aleph Crecimiento Pop-Up City event ran through much of March, turning parts of the city into collaborative, builder-centric spaces for several weeks.\n\nAll of this isn't happening by accident. Argentina already has one of the highest real-world crypto adoption rates in the world, thanks in part to people using stablecoins and digital assets as everyday payment and savings tools in an inflation-heavy economy. That gives the city something most \"crypto hubs\" only wish they had: actual usage, not just conference vanity. \n\nNow add in moves like Nexo acquiring Buenbit and making Buenos Aires its LATAM regional hub - and you start to see the real picture. That's a global platform positioning itself directly in the markets where people live and breathe crypto, at a time when infrastructure and talent are both exploding. They’re bringing institutional-grade security, yield products and credit tools that people here actually need - think of it as private crypto banking rooted in real adoption. \n\nWhat makes this interesting is how different it feels from past cycles. This is builders, users, regulators and platforms all pointing toward the same direction at once. The region is already showing its own cycles and liquidity patterns that don't always match the U.S. or EU - and big companies are now betting on that. \n\nSo yeah - while the world debates narratives, LATAM is producing results. If this trajectory holds, the next global crypto capital won't be New York or Singapore. It'll be Buenos Aires - and 2026 might be the year the world finally has to admit it.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 3, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pneecc/is_buenos_aires_quietly_becoming_the_next_global/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Someone posted a chart showing BTC crashing to $3 if that happened and sold off Satoshi's million coins.\n\nWilly Woo jumped in saying that old school Bitcoin holders would actually buy that flash crash. His point is that the Bitcoin network itself would survive because most coins today aren’t “instantly exposed” to a quantum attack in the same way the oldest ones are (especially if you’re not reusing addresses).\n\nHeres the issue tho. The numbers vary depending on how people count it, but it’s definitely “millions of BTC” that are more exposed. Some of it sits in really old formats like P2PK, and a bigger chunk is coins tied to reused addresses / situations where the public key is already known. Satoshi’s stash is part of that whole “very old coins” conversation people keep bringing up.\n\nAdam Back who's been around since Bitcoin's early days says we dont need to worry for like 20-40 years. He thinks theres plenty of time to upgrade everyone to quantum-resistant security before any real threat emerges. Standards for quantum-proof encryption already exist apparently.\n\nThe intresting part is that analyst James Check says the real risk isnt the technology itself but the market panic. He says theres \"no chance\" the Bitcoin community would agree to freeze Satoshi's coins before they get hacked, so if it happens we'd see massive selling pressure.\n\nalso, if panic trading actually hits, the boring stuff becomes painful fast. people will swap a ton, move coins around, maybe jump chains. and then months later you’re trying to untangle what you did. tools like awaken.tax are basically for that exact mess, just keeping cost basis and reports clean when things get chaotic.\n\nPersonally I think if quantum computers advanced that fast we'd have bigger problems than Bitcoin prices lol.

Cypherpunks, crypto bros, red pills, finfluencers, and other fantastic creatures sold a dream to the average dreamer: financial freedom, enhanced privacy, the end of monetary tyranny. Over the past decade, a romantic narrative captured libertarians and anarchists with the force of a gospel: Bitcoin (and other cryptos) would be the final refuge from the State. Unseizable money. Pseudonymity. The perfect tool to escape the tax-hungry frenzy of governments that treat citizens like taxable cattle—and from the parasitic banking system.\n\nWhat Amazon delivered to our doorstep was an omniscient, omnipresent surveillance system that charges transaction fees for the privilege of feeding it.\n\nMost users operate under the illusion of “pseudonymous anonymity.” There’s no name or Social Security number in the block explorer, therefore we’re protected. That’s only true in a world without external context.\n\nBitcoin is an immutable ledger. Every unit carries its entire history. Unlike cash—which has no memory—Bitcoin remembers. Always. This isn’t an accidental flaw; it’s the heart of the system.\n\nWhen funds leave a KYC exchange and arrive in a self-custodied wallet, the link is established. No need to break cryptography. Graph analysis does the rest. Identifiable entry points make the system retrospectively transparent.\n\nThis is structural. Even with perfect opsec, a public blockchain remains an eternal database.\n\nIt’s important to distinguish: possibility is not inevitability. States aren’t omniscient, nor do they have infinite resources. Jurisdictions vary. Priorities change.\n\nBut modern surveillance doesn’t work case by case. It works by accumulating data and applying it selectively later. An irrelevant event today can become incriminating tomorrow. The evidence doesn’t decay. It doesn’t technically expire. It just waits for sufficient interest.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t guarantee persecution. It guarantees retroactive auditability. That’s already a lot.\n\n“Fine,” you say, adjusting your metaphorical hoodie, “then I’ll use Monero. Its blockchain is opaque.”\n\nAnd here things get more interesting—and sadder.\n\nMonero’s cryptography is genuinely robust. Ring signatures, stealth addresses, obfuscated amounts. Direct transaction tracing is genuinely hard. But you, dear anon, may be the weak link. In modern forensic accounting, when we can’t follow the money, we follow the device. Or behavioral patterns. Or both.\n\nUsing a privacy coin on a regular computer is like locking the safe and leaving the key under the doormat.\n\nYour IP address: if you access your bank and your Monero wallet from the same home Wi-Fi without Tor or a decent VPN, your ISP can correlate the data. It depends on cooperation and analysis, but the possibility exists—and possibilities have a habit of materializing when there’s enough state interest.\n\nYour phone’s MAC address: if you installed a KYC exchange app on the same device you use to access anonymous accounts, the device chassis becomes your fingerprint. Dedicated devices mitigate this. Most people don’t use dedicated devices.\n\nCanvas fingerprinting: websites silently ask your browser to draw an invisible image. Micro-variations in your GPU make that drawing unique like a fingerprint. Visit a regulated site and then an anonymous market in the same browser without blockers, and the hash identifies you—VPN or not. This isn’t Monero’s fault. It’s a structural vulnerability of the modern web.\n\nMonero offers superior on-chain privacy. Off-chain, it’s a different battle—and it requires rigorous opsec that most people don’t practice.\n\nIn trying to erase traces, many turn to mixers. Tornado Cash. CoinJoin. The promise of “cleaning” coins.\n\nFrom a forensic standpoint, you’re not necessarily cleaning the money. You’re flagging it as suspicious.\n\nBitcoin’s fungibility is a polished fiction. Compliance tools used by major exchanges—Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace—automatically label funds that passed through mixers as “High Risk” or “Potential Illicit Activity.” Especially after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, using a mixer became almost a confession.\n\nTry sending those “mixed” funds to Binance or Coinbase. The outcome is predictable: immediate freeze. The algorithm detects the mixer, locks your balance, opens a compliance case. You wanted privacy. You got radioactive money—useless in the formal economy.\n\nThere are more sophisticated strategies, specific contexts where mixers work. But for the average user, trying to hide often makes things worse.\n\nWhat about instant swaps? Offshore exchanges that promise no documents?\n\nSome work. For now. But they carry a risk few properly calculate: in the worst case, they’re honeypots. Traps run or infiltrated by the very people you’re trying to avoid.\n\nThese companies live in gray zones. Their survival depends on the tolerance—explicit or tacit—of global authorities. Many adopt quiet compliance to avoid shutdown. The risk trigger works like this: if incoming funds look suspicious, the system freezes the deposit and demands a passport to release it. You enter anonymous. You leave forcibly identified.\n\nEven platforms that don’t ask for a name at entry log IP, timestamp, transaction hash. When Interpol or the tax authority sends a subpoena, many “libertarian” exchanges hand over the logs immediately. It depends on jurisdiction, pressure, and the cost-benefit of resisting.\n\nThe platform promising anonymity today may be compelled—or simply decide—to cooperate tomorrow.\n\nThe forums’ favorite excuse: “I’ll say I was hacked. That I lost the private key in a boating accident.”\n\nThe State doesn’t play only by the rules of cryptography. It uses net worth analysis.\n\nIf you claim to have lost your crypto fortune but the following year buy property in cash, the tax authority applies the net worth method. Where did that money come from? A judge can reverse the burden of proof: prove lawful origin. If you can’t—because the origin is the crypto you swore sank at sea—the situation gets ugly.\n\nThe blockchain validates the transaction. Economic reality validates intent.\n\nFor local, physical exchanges, cash is still unbeatable.\n\nFor private digital transactions, coins like Monero work—provided they’re paired with rigorous opsec, dedicated devices, and acceptance of friction.\n\nFor the average user seeking “effortless financial freedom,” Bitcoin offers something different from what was promised: permanent global traceability.\n\nNo one said it would be easy. They said it would be revolutionary. Maybe it’s both. Maybe the revolution just isn’t the one we were promised.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 19, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pm05z2/blockchain_is_the_sweetest_dream_of_state/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nAlso, the second you *do* recover something like this, there’s a whole “ok now what” layer people forget. Cost basis, old exchange records, DeFi trails, what’s taxable vs what’s just a transfer. That part isn’t fun, but it’s real. Stuff like Awaken tax exists basically for that exact cleanup when your history is chaotic and you don’t want to guess and overpay.  \n  \nIts kinda funny but also dark when you think about how much wealth is permanently locked away because people forgot passwords or lost hardware. This movie will probably give everyone watching anxiety about their own crypto storage.\n\nWill definately watch this just to see how they handle the technical aspects and whether they make it accurate or go full Hollywood nonsense.", "lang": null, "likes": 18, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pkzwn8/netflix_is_making_a_comedy_movie_about_a_couple/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Move along if not interested.\n\nI was involved in crypto from 2020-2022ish. Did the research, drank the metaphorical cool-aid. Cryptocurrency resonated with me due to a love of finance, technology and decentralization independence. Not to mention the slew of problems materializing and present in traditional fiat finance.\n\nI made some money, and thought I would be a forever holder. But then got caught up in the Celsius and BlockFi bankruptcies. Eventually leading to the sale of all of my cryptocurrency due to the belief that the layman would never be savvy enough to store their own keys, and centralized layer 2 was just reinventing the traditional finance system, but with less consumer protections.\n\nFast forward to today, a hobby miner caught my interest and reignited my passion for crypto.\n\nSo here I am, trying to convince myself to get back into cryptocurrency. However, upon further research, the foundation of crypto seems to have changed.\n\nPrimarily my concerns are the following:\n\n1.\t⁠The upcoming security budget problem as the Bitcoin halving continues to make mining less profitable.\n\n2.\t⁠MSTR and the flywheel leverage default risk.\n\n3.\t⁠Tether minting unverified stablecoins that prop up the crypto market. (this one existed when I was in crypto prior also)\n\nHow are all of you navigating these risks? Like I said, I WANT to be involved, because i recognize the value of a decentralized network.

Raw accuracy alone can be misleading without this adjustment.\n\nThis should help distinguish creators who show real skill from those who primarily make safe predictions that tend to happen anyway.\n\n\n\n# Early results (raw accuracy only — baseline coming next):\n\n# 1.

My previous post, “[Altcoin Season Is Canceled](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pr0d56/altseason_is_canceled_forever)” got 240K views. Clearly, many people are wondering what is happening with altcoins and what their future looks like.\n\nMost commentators debated whether we actually had an altcoin season at all. One user, u/MaximumStudent1839, identified my pain point and argued that the whole \"ownership\", \"equity\", and \"cash flow\" was misleading and \"brain hemorrhage\". His view was simple: tokens should be treated as store-of-value assets driven purely by consensus. No future cash flows, no fee growth, no usage-based valuation. Just owning tokens based on their role and necessity within a given blockchain. Bullish on network-effect assets and bearish on some DeFi tokens, \"ICM\" tokens, etc.\n\nIn that framing, crypto is not a security, registered or unregistered. It is a collectible, sometimes with utility tied to an adjacent protocol.\n\nWhile I was responding to comments, Stani, the founder of Aave landing protocol, was effectively demonstrating how this theory plays out in practice.\n\nI made a video braking down how AAVE DAO debacle unfolded [https://youtu.be/NLDFTqavmNA](https://youtu.be/NLDFTqavmNA) and how Gary Gensler might have been right.\n\nThe moment the SEC dropped its investigation early Dec '25, Aave Labs switched the swap provider on its frontend and redirected fees away from the DAO. The amount is not huge - $10m, roughly one ninth of total Aave fees. Still, the principle matters. AAVE token holders do not benefit if fees accrue anywhere outside the DAO treasury.\n\nThis raised a key question. Should the DAO control all Aave IP and all fees generated by its storefront? Some may think this is not very important, but what if storefront fees eventually exceed protocol fees? AAVE holders should care where value is created and where it flows.\n\nThe vote happened, and Stani voted against the initiative, carrying about 33% of the voting power. Days before the vote, he spent roughly $12M buying AAVE. Good for price, bad for decentralization. Other large holders abstained. And realistically, why would they vote against the founder? He is responsible for their gains and has the most skin in the game.\n\nNow consider the real risk. What if tomorrow there is a decision to funnel protocol fees to another wallet and cut off the DAO entirely? Would the minority be able to unite and vote against it?\n\nDAOs are a compelling idea, but in practice the founding team has the final say. If they decide to sell the labs, as we saw with Axelar, Padre, and Tensor, token holders have no real way to intervene.\n\nSo you can throw most of the decentralization and governance narrative out the window. It does not work in the real world. Like communism, it sounds good on paper. When trying to make everyone equal - someone will always be more equal than others.\n\nTo be precise, it does work, just not the way it is advertised. DAOs simplify corporate governance, make it transparent, and put voting onchain. But they only cover the technical layer of governance, not ownership or control.\n\nAt the end of the day, crypto tokens function like unregistered securities. The best outcome we can realistically hope for is that the current SEC administration under Paul Atkins carves out a niche with more relaxed rules for digital securities.\n\nThat would simplify development and further integrate TradFi. At the same time, it would likely compress valuations, as criminal and scam capital would be forced out toward privacy chains that even most DEXs do not support.\n\nForget about altcoin season. Forget about “the next cycle.” Pumps will still happen, but only for a select few, mostly new tokens with the right timing, the right narrative, heavy marketing budgets, and VC or cabal bundling. Do not hold, and definitely do not DCA into any project tokens.\n\n2024–25 taught me that, in the long run, capital preservation matters more than capital growth. In 2026, I’m bullish on L1/L2 ecosystems and platform tokens with strong network effects, and bearish on most project coins.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year.", "lang": null, "likes": 89, "replies": 53, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pwhabi/aave_just_killed_decentralization_2026_outlook/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Pure DeFi hacks are relatively declining (even as TVL continues to rise), largely thanks to improved audits and security practices such as multisig wallets and timelocks.\n\nThat said, when exploits do happen today, they are often caused by **private key compromises or flawed contract logic**, rather than the classic flash loan attacks that were more common in earlier cycles.\n\nIn 2025, total crypto-related losses are estimated to exceed **$3–3.4 billion**, but a significant portion of those losses comes from **CEX incidents or individual wallet compromises**, not DeFi protocols alone.\n\n# Notable incidents in 2025\n\n* **UXLINK (September 2025)**: Multisig wallet compromised, unauthorized minting, losses estimated between **$10–30M** depending on sources. The incident had a major impact on the token and community interest. Some recovery efforts were later observed, with Bitget attempting to support activity through its **Crazy 48H – Phase 12** competition, which attracts traders seeking quick rewards and mechanically boosts trading volume.\n* **Balancer (November 2025)**: Major exploit across multiple chains, losses exceeding **$128M**. A rounding/logic bug enabled large-scale fund drainage, making it one of the largest DeFi incidents of the year.\n* **Yearn Finance (2025)**: Ongoing concerns around persistent vulnerabilities despite multiple audits, leading to significant losses.\n* **GriffinAI (September 2025)**: Private key compromise combined with a misconfigured bridge, resulting in abusive token minting (\\~**$3M**).\n* **Typus Finance (October 2025)**: Approximately **$3.4M** lost.\n* **Shibarium Bridge (September 2025)**: Flash loan used to gain control, losses around **$2.4M**.\n\nThese incidents highlight a recurring issue: **even with audits in place, admin key centralization remains one of the biggest systemic risks in crypto**.\n\nThat said, my view is more nuanced. If a project:\n\n* is transparent about what went wrong,\n* fixes the root cause properly,\n* improves its security model,\n* and continues building,\n\nthen surviving a hack doesn’t automatically mean the project is finished. In some cases, it can even strengthen long-term resilience, although it almost always leaves a lasting dent in trust.\n\n**Curious to hear your perspective:**  \nDoes a hack permanently break your confidence in a project, or does the response and recovery matter more than the incident itself?", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pulns7/how_does_a_hack_change_your_perception_of_a/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

On one hand, bringing fresh blood into the space is always good for adoption. On the other hand, projects that focus heavily on marketing rather than technology often raise red flags for me.\nHere's my main concern: I've read through their materials and I still don't fully understand what problem they're actually solving or what their core value proposition is. The website has a lot of buzzwords and promises, but the actual utility seems vague. Is it a DeFi platform? An infrastructure project? It's not entirely clear to me.\nI'm also wondering if this is genuinely innovative or just repackaging existing concepts with slicker marketing. The crypto space has seen plenty of projects that generate a lot of noise but don't contribute anything meaningful to the ecosystem.\nHas anyone here actually used WeFi or dug deep into their whitepaper?\nDoes their technology stack make sense, or is it mostly vaporware?\nAre there any red flags I should be aware of?\nIs this actually innovative, or just good at PR?\nI want to keep an open mind, but I'm naturally skeptical of projects that seem to prioritize marketing over substance.

This sub isn’t very fond of memecoins, but there are a few of us here.  \nWe are now in the 3rd memecoin winter, and after the Oct 10 lows, we’re picking up steam again, with more tokens deployed, more graduating, and higher volume. Tokenized communities end up being stickers then jpegs.   \n(attaching some ss at the end)\n\nEveryone talks about 10000x and pnl ss, but very few talk about survival. After trading memecoins for over two years, one thing has become painfully clear to me: capital preservation is the real edge, not finding the next 67.\n\nPersonally, I started with roughly 40 sol but stuck to 5% risk per trade (2 sol per trade). While making a tutorial on memecoin trading, I debated what the absolute minimum is to survive in the trenches.\n\nBesides ruggers, drainers, and extractors, memecoin trading has a lot of taxes that compound. It’s not just buy and hope. Every trade is taxed by reality. You pay trading fees, terminal fees, priority fees, bribes, failed transactions, slippage, and opportunity cost. All of that adds up very quickly. When learning and starting with only 10 sol (\\~$1.3k), traders often forget to adjust their axiom buy/sell filters, and fees eat their sol.\n\nOver time, it becomes obvious that undercapitalization is the number one reason people fail. Trading with tiny size forces you into bad decisions. You chase harder, hold longer, and gamble more because the math no longer works. That’s why I believe 10 sol is the minimum threshold to trade memecoins seriously. If you don’t have 10 sol that you’re fully prepared to lose, you probably shouldn’t be trading memecoins at all.\n\nWith 10 sol, trading 0.2 sol per trade makes sense. That’s roughly 2% risk per trade. You can get rugged 50 times straight. You can learn how narratives move, how liquidity behaves, and how social signals evolve without blowing up your stack in a single afternoon. Survival gives you time, and time is the only thing that compounds in this market.\n\nSome KOLs advise against such small numbers and say to get a job instead. No comments. Others say they grew small stacks into meaningful ones. Maybe they did. But the real question is whether that’s repeatable without pure luck. Is it realistic to grow from very small size once fees and bribes are factored in?\n\nI’m curious where others land on this. We aren’t getting many $10m mooners these days. Is 10 sol truly enough to learn the ropes? Is 0.2 sol the right position size once all costs are considered? And more importantly, should capital preservation be the primary goal in memecoin trading, or is that mindset incompatible with the market itself?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nState of memecoins in Dec 2025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/957mwhgvvn7g1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa2794448bddf2790c3755ccf8e680108f2b8f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcgppggvvn7g1.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dbf44966caa39f8d15399bd5f416e10583e83cd", "lang": null, "likes": 14, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1poivbd/meme_coin_traders_is_02_sol_per_trade_enough/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Kwon can potentially face more time back in South Korea, and prosecutors there have talked about seeking a very long sentence too.\n\nThe takeaway here is pretty clear. cooperation + remorse matters a lot, and going to trial + lying under oath will get you hammered.\n\nalso kinda wild side note: both of these cases are basically “paper trail” cases. not saying taxes are the same thing as fraud, but it’s why i’m big on keeping clean records now. if you’re a normal person just staking/trading, at least don’t let the boring stuff ruin you later. i’ve been testing Koinly and Awaken.tax just to keep wallets/defi/exchange history readable in one place.", "lang": null, "likes": 230, "replies": 69, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pkheq9/do_kwon_just_got_sentenced_to_15_years_for_a_40/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

These updates highlight significant financial growth, key integrations, new sponsorships, and upcoming governance proposals for the DAO's development.\n\n# 1. Major News and Updates\n\n• The DAO has officially voted to approve formal legal registration through MIDAO. All documentation has been completed and submitted. I (u/002\\_timmy) have completed KYC, and MIDAO has forwarded our paperwork to the Government of the Marshall Islands. We have been told to expect an answer in approximately one month. At this stage, the process is entirely in the hands of the Marshall Islands government.\n\n• Polygon Labs is once again sponsoring subreddit creator rewards in the amount of $5,000 worth of POL. This continues their strong support for r/CryptoCurrency and our community rewards program.\n\n• u/jwinterm has soft-launched the new community hub website: rcryptocurrency.com. This site will replace and significantly expand upon the current ccmoons.com functionality.  \nCurrent features include viewing token KPIs (holders, earners, price, supply), subreddit statistics, karma estimators, Moon history, integrated Uniswap trading, and more functionality coming soon.\n\n# 2. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/) &amp; [https://rcryptocurrency.com/](https://rcryptocurrency.com/)  \nNew Community Hub (soft launch): [https://rcryptocurrency.com](https://rcryptocurrency.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance (Snapshot): [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nAdvertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 3. Treasury Overview (as of December 8, 2025)\n\nAsset balances and valuations:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,190|$42,885|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,619|\n|USDC|2,080|$2,080|\n|USDT|1,366|$1,366|\n|USDC.E|$487|$487|\n|ARB|1,848|$393|\n\nTotal non-Moon value: $6,945  \nChange since last update: -$ 5,223\n\nStablecoin value (USDC + USDT + USDC.E): $3,933  \nPrevious stablecoin total: $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins: -$4,681\n\nThe largest expense was $6,100 USDC for MIDAO legal registration, sent directly to MIDAO.\n\nThe DAO added \\~$1400 in stablecoins, excluding the MIDAO payment.\n\n# 4. Burn Summary\n\nNew burn totals:\n\nArbitrum Nova: 3,197,609  \nArbitrum One: 1,038,816  \nTotal burned: 4,236,425 Moons\n\nPrevious totals (November 9):  \nNova: 3,189,800  \nOne: 1,038,094  \nTotal: 4,227,894\n\nChanges since last update:  \n• Nova burn increase: 7,809 (driven mostly by Kraken’s AMA event)  \n• Arbitrum One burn increase: 722  \n• Combined burn increase: 8,531 Moons\n\nBurns on Arbitrum One remain low as incoming revenue is being used to compensate for Kraken’s pure burn, per the transparency report.\n\n# 5. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DoL)\n\nThe DAO currently maintains one liquidity pool position.\n\nCurrent composition:  \n• 93,100.95 Moons  \n• 284.62 USDC\n\nValue breakdown:  \n• Moon value: $4,839  \n• USDC value: $284.62  \n• Total DoL value: $5,124.52\n\nThis is lower than last month due to Moon price moving from approximately $0.0634 to $0.0519.\n\nThe low USDC proportion reflects the fact that as sponsor revenue enters the DAO, market conditions have pushed Moon’s price downward, causing the pool to accumulate more Moons and less USDC. This is functioning effectively as automatic buy pressure, allowing sellers to exit into deep liquidity while the DAO accumulates Moons cheaply.\n\nAs additional revenue arrives, we will continue rebalancing the pool and shifting toward a 50–50 asset split. If Moon’s price rises, the balance will naturally adjust.\n\n# 6. Distribution Update\n\nPolygon Labs is sponsoring $5,000 in POL tokens for creator rewards. Subreddit users will receive 32,000 POL tokens.\n\nFor Moon Week 69, the DAO will distribute 7,440 Moons.  \nDuring Moon Epoch 69, the distribution wallet received 7,441 Moons.\n\nThe Community Currency App has continued to experience occasional technical issues. If the claim interface is down, users may use manual withdraw commands. We encourage anyone with issues to ask for help.\n\nLong-term, the plan is to migrate claims to [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com), where users will be able to claim rewards directly from our website without relying on the external app.\n\nSince the last update, three projects held AMAs:  \n• Kraken  \n• Stellar  \n• Space Computer\n\nThis is a normal slowdown for year-end in crypto, as many teams pause marketing during holiday periods and uncertain market conditions.\n\n# 7. Governance Update\n\nThere were no governance proposals this round.\n\nHowever, one user has applied for the vacant Ecosystem Growth Officer position. This nomination will go live as a formal governance vote once the MIDAO legal proposal cycle completes.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe primary focus remains on completing the transition to the new [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com) platform. This website will serve as the central community hub outside Reddit, offering dashboards, analytics, creator reward claiming, advertiser onboarding, and a wide range of community tools.\n\nDeFi integrations will continue to expand, including additional liquidity management and possible new partner protocols.\n\nI am actively working on a bridge contract with support from u/jwinterm. Our goal is to integrate bridging directly into [rcryptocurrency.com](http://rcryptocurrency.com), allowing users to move Moons seamlessly between Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nWe also hope to host a Moon livestream (MOON Stream) later this month to review everything the DAO accomplished in 2025, share the status of MIDAO recognition, and outline 2026 goals.", "lang": null, "likes": 21, "replies": 16, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1phptu0/ccmoon_dao_update_december_8_2025_moon_week_69/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1paox12", "author": "HSuke", "handle": "HSuke", "created_utc": 1764525883.0, "text": "Opinion: Hard Forks are necessary for eliminating technical debt, reducing excessive complexity, and keeping blockchains secure from outdated and insecure protocols ####**What is a Hard Fork?**\n\nHard forks are common for blockchains. Most newer and modern blockchains use a mix of soft and hard forks for updates. Older blockchains often soft fork to maintain backwards compatibility with old and insecure client versions.\n\nBy definition, a hard fork is an update or event that will result in a chain split if block producers and node clients continue using different versions.\n\n####**Soft Forks result in code bloat, dangerous practices, and technical debt**:\n\nSoft forks maintain backwards compatibility with older clients, so they need to add additional code logic to detect and deal with all the different types of clients they might encounter. This creates developer complexity and code bloat by continuously supporting archaic and dangerous practices.\n\n**Imagine what would happen without hard-forks**:\n\n* Newer WiFi routers would still support the insecure WEP or WPA protocol\n* Browser would still support old, insecure versions of SSL\n* Newer computers would still support Windows 3.0 (launched 1990) natively\n* Windows 11 would still support early 1990s Intel 386-generation hardware.\n* All city roads would still allow for horses and wagons.\n* All US stores would still accept 3-cent, 5-cent and 10-cent paper notes; and half-cent, 2-cent, and 3-cent, and large cents; and $100,000 bills.\n* Doctors would still support dangerous practices such as bloodletting, mercury prescriptions, arsenic prescriptions, and trepanning (drilling holes into skulls)\n\nIt's dangerous to never hard fork.\n\n####**Bitcoin soft forks results in complexity and update delays**\n\nBitcoin still supports many outdated legacy addresses such as P2PK, P2MS, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKSH, P2WSH. Each of these has their own special quirks, and every Bitcoin client needs to add additional complexity to support them. Many of these aren't quantum secure and should be prevented from transferring in the future, which requires a hard fork.\n\nBitcoin nodes also take forever to update to a new version. It wasn't until mid-2024 that most clients supported transferring to Bech32m addresses that were introduced in May 2021. Taproot, which requires Bech32m support, also took nearly half a decade to obtain significant client support. That's because unlike with hard forks, Bitcoin nodes aren't required to support the latest features. So it takes the Bitcoin network half a decade to pick up new features.\n\n####**Bitcoin has hard-forked at least twice, and that's perfectly fine**\n\nLastly, contrary to popular opinion, Bitcoin's canonical chain has actually hard forked at least twice unintentionally.\n\n1. There was a temporary 0.8 update related to the 2013 reorg (where a 51% attack and double-spend also occurred). Had the update been planned as a hard fork instead of soft fork, there wouldn't have been a disastrous chain split.\n2. The 0.3.6 OP_NOP update also resulted in a hard fork a year later when the first OP_NOPX transaction was submitted in block 163685.\n\nPre-0.3.6 Bitcoin clients no longer sync with newer versions due to a hard fork, and that's not a bad thing. No one should be running archaic versions of Bitcoin client.\n\nJameson Lopp discovered that 7 out of 21 known Bitcoin consensus updates were of the hard fork type and not the soft fork type. They could've been triggered by a \"poisoned\" transaction like in the November 2025 Cardano chain split, but no one ever submitted one for 5 of them. These include Bitcoin 0.2's best chain selection logic, Bitcoin OP_VER update prior to 0.3.6, the scriptSig bug patched in v0.3.7, the critical inflation bug patched in v0.15.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1paox12/opinion_hard_forks_are_necessary_for_eliminating/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Back then it was normal to see 15–20% APY and not ask too many questions. Now whenever I see double digits, my first thought is: *“what exactly is going to blow up to pay for this?”*  \n  \nFor me it kind of breaks down into three buckets: DeFi, sketchy CeFi, and the more regulated CeFi stuff.  \n  \nDeFi first. Yields are back on things like Curve, Pendle, Aave, etc., and if you know what you’re doing, there are still some really nice plays there. But nothing about the underlying risks has changed: smart contract exposure, exploits, governance drama, incentives that vanish the moment emissions run out. I’m happy to put part of my stack in DeFi, but I’m not pretending it’s “safe yield.” It’s still, “this might be fine, or this might be a lessons-learned post in three months.”  \n  \nThen you’ve got the classic offshore “trust me bro” platforms. The ones offering flashy APYs with zero transparency, vague T&amp;Cs, and some office somewhere you’d never actually visit. I used to dabble in those. Now? Hard pass. Too many stories where withdrawals get “temporarily paused” until everyone’s wiped out.  \n  \nThe last bucket is the more boring, regulated CeFi side. Think Nеxo, Gemini, and a couple of others. Actual licensing, audits, collateral frameworks - and at least a clear idea of where the yield comes from. The rates aren’t wild anymore, but the whole appeal is that it’s supposed to be boring.  \n  \nNеxo is the one I’ve ended up using for the stable part of my stack. After trying pretty much everything, a few things stood out. They’ve been operating for years without a single hack, which is rare in this industry. They’re properly licensed and supervised in multiple jurisdictions, not just “registered somewhere.” And their support is true 24/7 - when something feels off, you get a human, not a bot that replies three days later.  \n  \nRates for stables sit in that mid to high single-digit range depending on loyalty tier and setup. Nothing crazy, but consistent, transparent, and without lock-ins or gimmicks. For me that’s the point - if I wanted stress, I’d be farming on some new L2 with 14 audits and still pray nothing gets drained.  \n  \nOne thing I didn’t expect to use as much is their card. Being able to keep most of my liquidity in stablecoins, spend directly from that balance, and earn cashback without dealing with off-ramps or bank delays makes everyday spending a lot smoother. It’s closer to how crypto should feel: fluid and instant.  \n  \nNone of this is “go all in on X.” There’s no such thing as fully safe yield - just a spectrum from “this might get exploited tomorrow” to “this has a track record, regulation, and structure behind it.” But in 2025, I’d rather have fewer surprises and slightly lower APY than roll the dice for a few extra percent.  \n  \nCurious how everyone else is handling it now that stablecoins are moving again.

Aptos is leading the pack with an insane 0.08s, followed closely by Somnia (0.1s) and Sui (0.24s).\n\nL2s vs. High-Performance L1s: It's interesting to see Arbitrum (0.25s) sitting right up there with the parallelized L1s like Sui and Solana.\n\nSolana: Sitting at 0.4s, which is standard for them, but technically slower than the top 5 in this specific metric.\n\nThe 2-Second Standard: Chains like Base, Optimism, and Polygon are consistent at 2s.

This is a quality of life buff for users, devs and business.\n\nAs you can see in the tweet and in the image above these are the things that Fusaka brings to the table:\n\n* **30–60% cheaper transfers** \\- sending ETH or tokens is more affordable.\n* **3–5x faster-feeling transactions** \\- not instant but close to a no wait just send vibe.\n* **NFT minting costs drop 60–70%** \\-huge for creators, platforms and anyone making drops.\n* **More stability for businesses** \\- Less spikes, smother execution and almost no downtime.\n* **Developers save 25–35% on gas** \\- This will help devs to build more and have less things to cry about xD\n\nThe final result? A better user experience for everyone, from degen traders to Web3 startups or just for people who only touch Ethereum when they mint an NFT.\n\nThis is also cool because Fusaka boosts the whole modular ecosystem without trying to replace rollups or rewrite Ethereum's roadmap.\n\nDecember 3, dont forget that date, it will probably dont affect price in the short term but it will in the long term.\n\nAre you hyped for Fusaka?\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407)", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 21, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p660rr/ethereums_fusaka_upgrade_hits_dec_3_massive_ux/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The main reason is the yield structure. Stablecoin vaults consistently return around 5–7% in-kind, and on top of that, Katana distributes KAT rewards. Even though KAT isn’t tradable yet, if it launches with around a $1 billion FDV, my current yield would be about 40% APR. Even if it opens lower, the combination of base yield and rewards still makes it the strongest setup I’ve found across DeFi.\n\nWhat stands out most to me is how Katana approaches vault curation and risk management. The team doesn’t surface every vault available. They focus on a curated set that meets their transparency and risk standards. Vaults surfaced in the Katana app and curated through Vaultbridge were completely untouched by the xUSD and Balancer events that affected other platforms. That outcome reflects how Katana designs its system rather than reacting after the fact.\n\nVaultbridge works with partners like Steakhouse, Gauntlet, and Yearn to create transparent, onchain, risk-adjusted strategies built on blue-chip collateral with conservative LTVs. Katana then channels yield from these vaults back into the network through foundation-managed liquidity and reward programs. The result is consistent, visible, and repeatable yield onchain.\n\nKatana’s structure attracts institutional partners who care about both performance and capital protection. The design of the protocol puts fund safety, transparency, and sustainable yield at the core of the chain itself.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of platforms, and Katana is the one that’s managed to align strong yield, conservative risk management, and transparent onchain strategy. That’s why I’m comfortable keeping my funds there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2txepqzvyh0g1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dc93e51a29455b384724299b4646ab409e051c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18ba6taxyh0g1.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d37e101ebf1217446fb0d4d48d7aeef79c47f78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo0hgvvxyh0g1.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ade14250a9509324971cca9a40ea07da2a364c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbaye7iyyh0g1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c788bc40680a80a131f16af15430ab416f17ab9\n\nLink to tweet that inspired this post: [https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20](https://x.com/katana/status/1987956452837703874?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otprn3/why_ive_stuck_with_katana_through_all_the_recent/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

You create a Twitter handle. A Discord tag. A Reddit name. A login for every exchange, wallet, and dApp. None of them talk to each other, and none of them belong to you.\n\nThis fragmentation goes beyond inconvenience. It reflects a deeper problem: in the traditional web, your identity is something you rent, not something you own.\n\nWeb3 domains change that.\n\n# The Problem With Usernames\n\nUsernames are siloed by design. They’re tied to the platform where they were created, and they can be taken away, suspended, or reassigned at any time.\n\nYou can’t transfer your identity. You can’t verify it across apps. You can’t take it with you. And if someone else grabs the name you want, it’s gone — possibly forever.\n\nMore importantly, a username is not a credential. It exists only as long as the platform allows it.\n\n# What Makes Web3 Domains Different\n\nWeb3 domains are stored in your wallet and secured by the blockchain. No one can reassign them, edit them, or suspend them. Once minted, they’re yours.\n\nThat ownership unlocks functionality usernames simply can’t match. You can use the same domain to:\n\n* Log in to dApps\n* Receive crypto payments\n* Build a unified profile\n* Send and receive onchain messages\n* Access gated communities or experiences\n\nYou don’t need to re-register. You don’t need to manage multiple identities. You don’t need to trust a platform to respect your name. The system is built to work for you.\n\n# Built for Portability\n\nWeb3 domains are designed to move with you.\n\nInstead of creating a new username every time you join a new app, your domain follows you. You can connect it to social platforms, DeFi protocols, wallets, games, marketplaces, and more.\n\nAs adoption grows, your name becomes your default identity across the Web3 ecosystem. One name. One login. One profile. Persistent and portable.\n\n# One Identity, Not a Dozen Accounts\n\nTraditional usernames force you to build a reputation in isolated bubbles. You might have one users on Reddit and another on X. None of those profiles are connected. None of them tell a complete story.\n\nWith a Web3 domain, you maintain a consistent identity across apps. You don’t have to rebuild from scratch every time you try something new. Your domain becomes your access point, your public name, and your reputation anchor — all in one.\n\nThat continuity is valuable whether you’re a creator, a collector, a builder, or someone just getting started.\n\n# What About DNS Domains?\n\nNot all domains are equal. Some DNS domains can be placed onchain, allowing them to participate in the Web3 ecosystem. But DNS domains are still subject to renewals, registrar rules, and external control.\n\nWeb3 domains are fully minted onchain and owned outright. No renewals. No middlemen. No reliance on centralized infrastructure.\n\nIf the goal is ownership, this distinction matters.\n\n# Owning Your Name Means Owning Your Identity\n\nA username identifies you only within the boundaries of the platform that issued it.\n\nA Web3 domain gives you ownership of your name across platforms, protocols, and use cases. You can log in, transact, build, and communicate without needing to rebuild your identity every time.\n\nThe internet is shifting from accounts to identity. And identity starts with a name you actually control.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otk28c/why_web3_domains_are_better_usernames/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve seen a handful of crypto companies succeed.\n\nTo succeed, many hard things must align. To fail, only one key thing needs to go wrong.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in this space, one pattern repeats itself: **the fastest path to failure is biasing toward idealism over pragmatism.**\n\nI joined the industry for its ideals. It took years - and a few hard lessons - to unlearn them.\n\n# Not About Memes or Casinos\n\nThis post is about projects trying to *create* value, not extract it. Those building new rails, not just running the same casino onchain.\n\nMemes and casinos have their own kind of Product-Market-Fit. They entertain, they speculate, they move money. But they don’t *build*. They redistribute value rather than generate it.\n\n**In short, this post is about teams growing the pie, not just grabbing the bigger slice.**\n\n*Now that the disclaimer’s out of the way, let’s get into it.*\n\n# Changing My Mind\n\nI first dipped my toes into crypto in 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on Gitter. For the past four years, I’ve been all in, building full-time.\n\nThat transition, from observer to participant, is when you start facing real tradeoffs. It’s when you stop quoting whitepapers and start debugging production systems. And it’s when your ideals begin to meet reality.\n\nBelow are examples I often bring up when discussing how **pragmatism (not purity) led to success.** These are companies I’ve been learning from.\n\n# Pragmatic Successes\n\n[**PolyMarket**](https://www.polymarket.com/) proved that stablecoins beat custom tokens for early traction in prediction markets. Back in 2016, [Augur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution) kicked off the decentralized prediction markets ecosystem. Most people today haven’t heard of Augur, and know Gnosis mainly as a multisig or credit card company. But, everyone’s heard of PolyMarket, especially after their [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). Their key move was focusing on product over tokenomics, avoiding getting [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by shiny ideals.\n\n[**Solana**](https://www.solana.com/) showed that choosing speed over decentralization can capture real users. Solana’s vision was to run at the speed of the Nasdaq onchain. One of crypto’s deepest ideals is that anyone should be able to run a node or validator at home, in their basement, on a laptop, as part of the network’s collective strength. In practice, running a Solana validator requires professional-grade hardware and DevOps skills. It’s like needing to be an F1 driver just to commute to work. Solana made the hard tradeoff of centralization for performance, and it paid off. With a \\~$91B market cap, pragmatism clearly won.\n\n**Stablecoins** became crypto’s paradoxical success by embracing regulation and existing rails. Bitcoin dreamed of divorcing from the existing financial system; stablecoins married it. Now they’re on track for [$46T in annual volume](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/), with [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) IPOing and the [GENIUS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) adding clarity. They’re as anti-crypto-ideal as it gets, and yet, not showing any signs of slowing down.\n\n[**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/) thrived by offering custody and compliance instead of maximalist purity. Crypto said: *Not your keys, not your coins.* Coinbase said: *Most people don’t want to manage keys.* They made the pragmatic choice to build for real users, not ideals, and onboarded millions because of it.\n\n[**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) is arguably one of the most successful wallets in crypto. Its mission is to bring people onchain, and I’ve heard dozens of founders say it’s the best thing that’s happened to the industry in years. Yet it doesn’t have a token, it isn’t *“crypto-native,”* and it relies heavily on AWS to store user keys \\[1\\]. Its CEO and co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer at FileCoin, a project that embodied true crypto ideals. That experience likely gave him a clear sense of when decentralization helps and when it only slows you down. Privy succeeded by focusing on the user experience over crypto ideals.\n\n**In crypto, pragmatism isn’t about compromise, it’s about sequencing. You can decentralize later. You can tokenize later. But you have to survive in the beginning.**\n\n# It’s Never That Simple\n\nFailure can hinge on one thing. Success demands a harmonic symphony: UI, UX, timing, execution, luck. All must play in tune.\n\nMost people in the OG crypto space start with ideals. That’s good as it draws in smart, mission-driven people. But idealism alone doesn’t build resilient systems.\n\n**Pragmatism doesn’t guarantee success. Idealism often guarantees failure.**\n\nThe only true exceptions? Bitcoin and Ethereum. \\[2\\]\n\n# A Thought to End On\n\n**Decentralization is a byproduct of a permissionless and incentivized system.** It’s an end to a means, not a means to an end.\n\nA fully privacy-preserving, decentralized, permissionless world sounds perfect in theory. In practice, it stalls progress, innovation, and usability.\n\nIn crypto, as in life, **survival belongs to the pragmatists.**\n\n# tl;dr How to Bias Toward Pragmatism over Idealism\n\n1. **Don’t tokenize too early.** Start with stablecoins or fiat rails.\n2. **Don’t decentralize too early.** Use centralized infra, design for later decentralization.\n3. **Find Product-Market Fit first.** Once you have PMF, you can afford ideals and earn the right to strive towards them.\n\n\\---\n\n\\[1\\] Ironically, the world’s most private messenger (Signal) [runs mostly on AWS](https://www.theverge.com/news/807147/signal-aws-outage-meredith-whittaker). It works because users value reliability over purity.\n\n\\[2\\] I’d argue that Zcash is a third exception, but one that’s not known as well (yet). I remember listening to the podcast episode on [The Ceremony: Birth of Zcash](https://ma.ttias.be/podcast-ceremony-birth-zcash/) back in 2017 and being blown away by the amount of work that went into it.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1otgvik/the_key_lesson_i_learned_after_nearly_a_decade_in/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

This update highlights significant financial growth, key integrations, new sponsorships, and upcoming governance proposals that will shape the next phase of the DAO’s development.\n\nThe DAO continues to progress toward formal legal registration through MIDAO, expanding partnerships, and strengthening DeFi use cases for Moons. In the weeks since the last update, we have seen strong revenue inflows, expanded liquidity positions, and new integrations that continue to bring real utility and value to the ecosystem.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\nCCMOON DAO Constitution v0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution)  \nWebsite: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0)  \nGovernance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth)  \nr/CryptoCurrency Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck)  \nTransparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of November 9, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $12,168 in non-Moon assets and 823,192 Moons.\n\nMoons decreased by 25,000, representing a transfer to the Community Currency App Bot to refill rewards for outstanding distributions. ETH remains unchanged in quantity but decreased in fiat value due to price movement. The DAO’s stablecoin holdings increased significantly as more sponsorship payments were received.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|823,192|$52,157|\n|ETH|0.83683|$2,998|\n|USDC|6,826|$6,826|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$556|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: $12,168  \nChange since last update: +$3,417  \nStablecoin value (USDC, USDT, USDC.E): $8,614  \nChange in stablecoins since last update: +$3,489\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nArbitrum One: 1,038,094 Moons burned  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,189,800 Moons burned  \nTotal burned: 4,227,894 Moons\n\nSince the October 30 update:  \n• Arbitrum Nova increased by 57,546 Moons (largely from Kraken’s burn event)  \n• Arbitrum One increased by 117 Moons  \n• Combined total increase: 57,663 Moons burned\n\nThese burns highlight continued advertiser demand and the positive impact of large-scale partner events on Moon supply reduction.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nThe DAO now operates two Uniswap liquidity positions to improve balance and fee efficiency.\n\nFirst position (original pool, 0.05% fee tier):  \n• Composition: 67,654 Moons and 960 USDC  \n• Value: $5,455  \n• Total fees earned since last update: $134.37  \n• Breakdown: 1,081 Moons and 62.53 USDC collected  \n• These fees will be redeployed into liquidity after collection\n\nSecond position (new pool, 0.3% fee tier):  \n• Composition: 2,379 Moons and 126.02 USDC  \n• Value: $284.08  \n• Fees earned: $0.74\n\nCombined DAO-owned liquidity value: $5,739.08  \nChange since last update: +$1,948\n\nThese two positions give the DAO flexibility to capture more trading volume during price swings and maintain deeper market presence without needing to sell Moons for rebalancing.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nPolygon Labs has contributed $5,000 in POL tokens to the DAO, equivalent to 25,000 POL for distribution to subreddit users.\n\nFor Moon Week 68, the DAO will distribute 6,820 Moons, reflecting cumulative revenue-based allocation since Epochs 67 and 68.\n\nThe Community Currency App is now fully back online. Redundancies have been added to ensure users can always claim their rewards in the event of future outages.\n\nSince the last update on October 29, the DAO received $8,284 in new revenue from Kraken, Monad, [Rails.xyz](http://Rails.xyz), Quickswap, and ETH Strategy. Kraken’s payment was a pure burn, so the DAO will make up the equivalent amount by allocating future revenues to the Distribution, Treasury, and DAO-Owned Liquidity pools before resuming additional burns.\n\n# 6. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo major proposals will go live this Moon Week:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities that add utility and visibility to Moons.\n\nThese votes mark key next steps for formal structure and operational autonomy within the DAO.\n\n# 7. Teller Integration and Moon Utility\n\nMoons are officially live on Teller, and users can now use their Moons as collateral to borrow USDC or deposit them to earn yield. Teller held an AMA on the subreddit to guide users through the process.\n\nThis integration provides another major use case for Moons in DeFi. Teller’s initial incentive pool is paying a high APY for Moon deposits, funded directly by their treasury, though rewards will decrease over time as total deposits grow.\n\n# 8. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO’s top priority remains completing legal registration with MIDAO as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize structure, provide legal protection, and enable direct contracting with partners.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n• Continuing DeFi integrations like Teller and Uniswap liquidity expansion  \n• Pursuing grants to support DEX integrations on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n• Building faster bridge solutions between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One  \n• Hosting recurring AMAs and live DAO updates across platforms to expand beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for November 9, 2025. The next update will provide results from the Moon Week 68 governance votes, updated revenue totals, and any additional partnership or liquidity developments.", "lang": null, "likes": 32, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1osv3w1/ccmoon_dao_update_november_9_2025_1_day_prior_to/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

A real transaction, secured by ***Falcon-1024 signatures***, now lives immutably on the Algorand ledger, a transaction that even the world’s most advanced future quantum computer couldn’t break.\n\nFor context, this isn’t just a technical milestone. It’s a statement of intent, one that reshapes what blockchain security means in an era where quantum computing is no longer science fiction but an approaching inevitability.\n\n*“This isn’t theory anymore,”* I added. *“Algorand has crossed the bridge. The rest of the industry is still building.”*\n\n# Why Quantum Resistance Matters\n\nTo understand why this moment matters, you need to understand the risk. Nearly every blockchain today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even most of the newer ones, relies on *RSA* or *elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)* to verify ownership and authenticate transactions. These systems work beautifully against classical computers.\n\nBut against a quantum computer? They crumble.\n\nSince *Peter Shor’s algorithm* in ***1994*** proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum machine could factor large numbers or compute discrete logarithms instantly, cryptographers have known what’s coming. It’s not a matter of *if*, but *when*.\n\nThe danger isn’t just futuristic. There’s what security experts call the *“harvest now, decrypt later”* problem. Bad actors can collect encrypted blockchain data today, store it, and wait until quantum machines mature, then decrypt everything at once.\n\nWhen that day comes, every wallet, signature, and identity built on today’s encryption could be compromised.\n\nThis is why Algorand’s step isn’t about bragging rights. It’s about survival and foresight.\n\n# Falcon: The Cryptographic Shield of the Future\n\nAt the heart of this breakthrough is ***Falcon,*** a lattice-based signature algorithm co-developed by cryptographic heavyweights like *Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert*, and *Vinod Vaikuntanathan,* with contributions from Algorand’s own *Dr. Zhenfei Zhang*.\n\nFalcon, which stands for *Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU*, was selected by *NIST in 2022* as a global standard for post-quantum digital signatures.\n\nIt’s efficient, compact, and incredibly hard to break even for quantum computers.\n\nFalcon comes in two main versions:\n\n* ***Falcon-512***, offering AES-128-level security.\n* ***Falcon-1024***, providing AES-192-level strength — what NIST calls *“Level 5,”* the highest security tier available.\n\nAlgorand uses Falcon-1024. It’s the same signature scheme that already protects Algorand’s *state proofs,*compact cryptographic snapshots that allow other blockchains to verify Algorand’s state without intermediaries.\n\nThe genius here lies in Falcon’s balance:\n\n* Its signatures are larger (around 1,280 bytes) but extremely fast to verify (under 100 microseconds).\n* Signing takes more computation, but verification, the part blockchains do millions of times per day, is lightning-quick.\n\nThat trade-off is perfect for Algorand, where every block involves thousands of signature checks per second.\n\n# Engineering the Impossible\n\nImplementing Falcon in production wasn’t as simple as swapping one signature scheme for another.\n\nFalcon uses *floating-point arithmetic* and *Fast Fourier transforms,* techniques that demand incredible numerical precision. One rounding error, and security could fail.\n\nThe Algorand Foundation’s team tackled this with a deterministic, constant-time implementation, ensuring no randomness or timing leaks that attackers could exploit.\n\nTheir guiding principles were clear:\n\n1. ***No disruption to consensus:*** verification had to remain deterministic.\n2. ***Seamless integration:*** of quantum-secure accounts is needed to act like normal ones.\n3. ***Developer accessibility:*** the system should be easy to use and experiment with.\n\nTo achieve that, Algorand built something elegant: embedding Falcon keys inside *Logic Signatures* smart contracts that control how an account’s funds can be spent.\n\nThese contracts verify Falcon signatures over transaction IDs. If the math checks out, the spend is authorized.\n\nFrom the network’s perspective, it looks no different from a traditional account only it’s *quantum-secure*.\n\n# Building the Tools for a Quantum Future\n\nTo make this accessible, Algorand released the ***Falcon Signatures CLI,*** a command-line toolkit that lets developers actually create, fund, and transact from post-quantum accounts on mainnet or testnet.\n\nDevelopers can:\n\n* Generate Falcon keypairs\n* Derive Algorand addresses from them\n* Fund those addresses\n* Sign and submit Falcon-verified transactions\n\nIn other words, anyone can now mint, sign, and send quantum-resistant transactions.\n\nThat’s not just innovation, it’s democratization of security.\n\n# What’s Protected — and What Isn’t (Yet)\n\nAlgorand’s post-quantum rollout secures individual accounts and the blockchain’s historical state. State proofs — those compact summaries used by other chains — are now fully quantum-resistant.\n\nBut the *consensus layer* still relies on *Ed25519* signatures and **V***erifiable Random Functions (VRFs)* for validator selection. These are classical cryptographic mechanisms that quantum computers could theoretically exploit.\n\nSo while quantum attackers couldn’t steal funds from Falcon-secured accounts, they might still disrupt block proposals or manipulate future consensus events.\n\nThat’s why Algorand’s approach is *incremental but deliberate*: start with user-level protection, gain experience, then move up the stack toward quantum-secure consensus.\n\nIt’s the practical path to secure what’s possible now and evolve systematically.\n\n# Falcon’s Broader Impact\n\nFalcon’s adoption by Algorand has implications far beyond a single blockchain.\n\nBecause it’s *NIST-standardized*, Falcon can act as a *universal language* for cross-chain communication in a *post-quantum world.*\n\nAlgorand’s *state proofs*, already powered by Falcon, could allow other chains to verify data trustlessly with the same cryptographic standard, no intermediaries needed.\n\nThat sets the stage for a *quantum-resistant multichain future* where interoperability and security coexist instead of colliding.\n\nThe open-source Falcon CLI also invites global collaboration developers, cryptographers, even universities can study and improve the system freely.\n\n# The Human Side: Algorand’s 2025 Roadmap\n\nWhile the Falcon achievement represents Algorand’s technical peak, its *2025 roadmap* reveals something just as profound: a shift toward simplicity, usability, and community control.\n\nIn an industry drowning in jargon and fractured ecosystems, Algorand’s message is refreshingly human. The roadmap centers around three core goals:\n\n1. ***Return power to the community***\n2. ***Make blockchain development frictionless***\n3. ***Deliver a user experience that feels like Web2 — but runs on Web3 principles***\n\n# Community Takes the Wheel\n\nAlgorand is handing the steering wheel to its users.\n\nThrough *Project King Safety*, the network plans to redesign its fee and incentive model to ensure long-term sustainability, ending the era of foundation-subsidized economics. A position paper is due in *Q4 2025*, outlining how fees, validator rewards, and network incentives will evolve.\n\nEven more transformative is the *revival of its grant program* under a *new governance structure.*\n\nA community-elected *xGov Council* will now decide which projects get funding — removing centralized gatekeeping and restoring grassroots governance.\n\nThe foundation has already *reduced its stake from 63% to 21%* through a new rewards model, and a *peer-to-peer gossip network* is replacing its centralized relay architecture.\n\nEach of these steps pushes Algorand closer to becoming a *fully peer-to-peer, self-governed ecosystem,*something most blockchains only claim to be.\n\n# Simplifying the Developer Experience\n\nThe next frontier is making blockchain development as easy as writing a mobile app.\n\nIn *early 2026*, Algorand will launch *AlgoKit 4.0,* a major upgrade that introduces composable smart contract libraries, key-value storage *(“Schema”)*, and native support for mainstream languages like ***Rust****,* ***Swift***, and ***Kotlin***.\n\nDevelopers will even be able to use ***AI assistants***, powered by large language models, to help write and debug contracts, merging artificial intelligence and blockchain into a single development flow.\n\n*“Algorand is building a bridge for developers who don’t want to learn ten new programming languages just to build on Web3.”*\n\nFor enterprises, *Intermezzo*, debuting in *Q3 2025*, will handle all the hard stuff: key management, blockchain integration, and compliance. Businesses will be able to launch blockchain-backed loyalty programs, digital assets, or identity systems with almost no technical friction.\n\nAnd for users? That’s where *Rocca Wallet* comes in.\n\n# Rocca Wallet: Web3 Without the Headache\n\nIf Falcon is the brain of Algorand’s evolution, *Rocca Walle***t** is its face.\n\nSet for *preview in Q4 2025* and an *open-source release in 2026*, Rocca aims to eliminate one of the biggest pain points in the crypto complex: intimidating wallets.\n\nIt supports *passkey logins* (no seed phrases), *fee abstraction* (users don’t even see *“gas*”), and *decentralized identity* (no centralized logins or data leaks).\n\nIt’s also *white-label*, meaning DApps can brand and customize it so the blockchain experience can fade into the background, letting usability take center stage.\n\nIn short, Rocca makes Web3 feel like Web2 only safer, faster, and fully decentralized.\n\n# Powering the Real World\n\nAlgorand’s 2025 vision also extends beyond the screen. It’s targeting real industries where blockchain can quietly improve everyday life:\n\n1. ***Tokenized Financial Products*****:** Using the *ACTUS framework*, Algorand is building smart contract models for tokenized debt and equity, with a *Debt ASA MVP* expected by *Q4 2025*.\n2. ***Agentic Commerce*****:** Supporting AI agents that can transact autonomously via ***X402*** and *A2A payments,* blurring the line between AI and DeFi.\n3. ***Self-Sovereign Identity*****:** The Rocca Wallet will enable verifiable credentials — like *WorldChess’s Universal Chess Passport*, which lets players compete globally without centralized logins.\n4. ***Data Integrity*****:** Strengthening blockchain’s role as a permanent, verifiable record for supply chains, enterprises, and beyond.\n\n# Privacy, Scalability, and the Quantum Edge\n\nAlgorand isn’t just catching up — it’s leaping ahead.\n\nIts upgraded ***AlgoPlonk*** zero-knowledge system will make privacy faster and more flexible, while exploration into *multiparty computation (MPC)* and *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* lays the groundwork for transactions that remain private even while being processed.\n\nMeanwhile, *parallel execution* and *block pipelining* are set to supercharge scalability, allowing multiple transactions to run at once and cutting block confirmation times even further.\n\nAnd in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the *first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*\n\n# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats\n\nIf the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.\n\nBut what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a *guardian layer,* a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?\n\nThat’s precisely where ***Algorand*** could step in.\n\nThrough its ***Falcon-based state proofs*** and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a ***quantum-safe validation hub*****,** a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing *BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins* to operate within a *quantum-secure environment* without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.\n\nImagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand’s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand’s *quantum-proof framework,* preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.\n\n*“If Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,”* I noted, *“it could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.”*\n\nThis kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to *stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails* as well. Since Algorand’s state proofs already support *trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.\n\nIt’s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand’s technology isn’t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be *future-proofing everyone else*, too.\n\n# Staying True to Web3’s Promise\n\nWhile other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:\n\n* *Transparency*\n* *Security*\n* *Community-led governance*\n* *Sustainability*\n\nIts uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn’t even exist yet.\n\n# A Glimpse at the Horizon\n\nAlgorand’s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.\n\nFalcon’s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  \nThe 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren’t opposites; they’re the same path forward.\n\nTogether, they redefine what *“Web3 readiness”* really means.\n\nIt’s not about speculation. It’s about *security that lasts decades, governance that empowers real people*, and *tools that anyone can use without a manual.*\n\nAlgorand’s post-quantum transaction didn’t just future-proof a blockchain, it *future-proofed the idea of trust itself.*\n\n# The Final Word\n\nFor all the industry talk about quantum threats, decentralized AI, and next-gen networks, only one blockchain has proven it’s ready for the next era: Algorand.\n\nFrom *Falcon’s lattice-based cryptography* to the *Rocca Wallet’s human-friendly design*, the network is merging the unthinkable military-grade security with intuitive simplicity.\n\n*“What Algorand did isn’t just technical brilliance, it’s vision,”* I concluded. *“They’re showing the world that security, decentralization, and user experience can finally coexist. It’s the evolution Web3 has been waiting for.”*\n\n# A Note on the Road Ahead\n\nQuantum computers are coming. AI is accelerating.  \nBut for once, blockchain isn’t lagging behind innovation; it’s leading it.\n\nAnd at the front of that pack, with its post-quantum Falcon wings already spread, stands ***Algorand.*** *Don’t give up on the underdog yet! This blockchain could surprise everyone at the end.*\n\nBecause the future doesn’t wait, and Algorand has decided it won’t either.\n\nSources:\n\n[Young, L. (2025, November 3).

The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.\n\nBefore Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.\n\nBeyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.\n\nBeyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nEvery operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.\n\nAcross Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.\n\nThe effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.\n\nIn parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.\n\nTogether, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.\n\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.

Ask us anything about the BONK Launchpad and the BONK DAT, BNKK Hello r/CryptoCurrency,\n\nWe are contributors from the BONK ( r/BONKfunOfficial ) ecosystem and team members involved with BONKfun and the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (Bonk Inc., ticker BNKK). We are here to discuss BONK’s ecosystem growth, the launchpad model, and how the treasury operates.\n\n# About BONK\n\nBONK is a community-driven token on Solana focused on building products that generate real activity and direct value toward the token. The BONK ecosystem includes BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, an NFT marketplace, and consumer-facing applications that bring new users to Solana. BONK currently has more than 400 integrations, operates on 13 chains, and is approaching one million onchain holders.\n\n# About BONKfun\n\nBONK . fun is a launchpad for meme tokens built around transparent economics. It allows anyone to create a token in minutes, with fees distributed to support the BONK ecosystem. Half of all platform fees are used to buy and burn BONK, 8 percent are used for BONK accumulation, and the remainder fund operations and development. Public dashboards track activity, fees, and burns in real time. The platform has become the largest launchpad on Solana, accounting for more than half of all new token launches in mid-2025.\n\n# About the BONK Digital Asset Treasury (BNKK)\n\nBonk Inc. (Nasdaq: BNKK) is the public-markets digital asset treasury dedicated to BONK accumulation. It receives a 10 percent revenue share from BONKfun and reinvests about 90 percent of that income into open-market BONK purchases. The company currently holds about 2.75 percent of BONK’s circulating supply and has stated a target of 5 percent by the end of 2025. The treasury is actively managed through partnerships with institutional asset managers to generate non-dilutive yield and preserve capital.\n\nThis structure connects ecosystem activity with public-company participation. Revenue from BONKfun creates recurring buy pressure, while the treasury establishes a corporate vehicle aligned with BONK’s long-term growth.\n\n# Topics we can discuss during the AMA\n\n* How BONKfun works and what differentiates it from other launchpads\n* The structure of BONK’s burn and buyback system\n* The design and purpose of the BONK Digital Asset Treasury\n* How revenue from BONKfun and other applications flows into BONK accumulation\n* The broader BONK ecosystem and integrations on Solana and other chains\n* The significance of approaching one million holders and the planned one-percent supply burn\n* The role of Bonk Inc. in bridging onchain activity with traditional finance\n\nWe will be answering questions from this thread during the AMA window.\n\nThank you for having us, and we look forward to your questions.\n\n— The BONK Team", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 79, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oq0oqq/ama_we_are_the_bonk_team_ask_us_anything_about/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Public companies and onchain organizations are increasingly holding tokens as long-term assets. To date, most treasuries have focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin. These assets offer stability and liquidity, but their size limits how much impact new accumulation can have.\n\nBONK occupies a different position. With a market capitalization of about $1 billion dollars, it sits in the mid-cap range, supported by an expanding ecosystem and a growing treasury. We believe this combination of scale and structure gives BONK a higher potential for compounding growth than the larger, slower-moving assets dominating current treasuries.\n\nThe BONK Digital Asset Treasury is operated through Bonk Inc. (BNKK). The company currently holds about 2.75% of the circulating supply and aims to reach 5% by the end of 2025. It earns a 10% revenue share from BONKfun and allocates roughly 90 percent of that income to open-market BONK purchases. This model transforms ecosystem activity into continuous, recurring accumulation.\n\nEach percentage of supply added to the treasury represents tens of millions of dollars in new demand. Because BONK’s market cap is smaller than traditional treasury assets, this level of accumulation has a more visible effect on overall market depth and pricing.\n\nBONK’s ecosystem is one of the most comprehensive among meme coins. It spans more than 400 integrations and operates on 13 chains. Core components include BONKfun, BONK Bot, BONK Swap, and an NFT marketplace, along with partnerships in sports, fitness, and entertainment. These products anchor BONK’s position within Solana while expanding its utility beyond trading.\n\nThe community is also approaching one million onchain holders. When that threshold is reached, a 1% supply burn will take place. Combined with ongoing burns from ecosystem products, this structure reinforces BONK’s deflationary design and long-term alignment with active users.\n\nWhat separates BONK from other digital asset treasuries is its leverage to growth. Large-cap assets require massive inflows to move the market, while BONK’s scale allows smaller amounts of new demand to create measurable change. It maintains liquidity across Solana and additional chains, offering accessibility while retaining room for appreciation.\n\nMost existing treasuries simply hold their assets. BONK’s approach creates a feedback loop in which product success funds further accumulation. It connects platform revenue, community activity, and corporate structure under one framework that compounds over time.\n\nBONK combines the community energy of a meme token with the operational discipline of a public treasury. It is verifiable, active, and built on a foundation of measurable economic inputs rather than speculation.\n\nIn the broader context of digital asset treasuries, BONK illustrates how smaller-cap assets can use real revenue and structured accumulation to drive value. It represents a faster, more reflexive model with the potential for greater upside as the ecosystem and treasury continue to expand.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1opcve8/bonks_digital_asset_treasury/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The past few weeks have been full of major progress across governance, treasury, partnerships, and real-world DAO formation efforts. What began as a decentralized subreddit project is now moving closer than ever to becoming a legally recognized organization with active DeFi integrations and expanding sources of revenue.\n\nThe most exciting development is that the DAO is now on the verge of becoming an officially recognized legal entity through MIDAO, based in the Marshall Islands. After a meeting with MIDAO representatives, we were offered a discounted rate of $6,100 through 2026 (normally $12,500) to register as a non-profit DAO LLC. This will give CCMOON DAO legal standing, limited liability protections, and greater legitimacy in future partnerships. A proposal is live now on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta, and the vote is scheduled for Moon Week 68.\n\nAnother major milestone is the Teller integration on Arbitrum One. Moons are now live on Teller, a decentralized lending protocol, offering 22% APY paid directly in Moons. Teller is funding this program from its own treasury by making market purchases of Moons to pay rewards. Within the first 48 hours, more than 1.5 million Moons—over $100,000 worth—were deposited. This is a massive leap forward for Moon utility and onchain participation.\n\nWe have also filled another key DAO Officer role, adding a Technology &amp; Infrastructure Officer. The current officer roster and open positions are listed below. The Community Engagement Officer and Ecosystem Growth Officer positions remain open, and the usual 50,000 Moon holding requirement has been removed so more members can participate. If you’d like to nominate yourself, you can do so on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta.\n\nOver the last 2.5 weeks, the DAO received about $5,000 in new revenue from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, BONKfun, and Polygon. This continues our growing stream of recurring payments that support burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity.\n\nLet’s take a look at where everything stands as of October 30.\n\n# 1. General Overview and Useful Links\n\nMoons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.\n\n* CCMOON DAO Constitution v 0.2.1 (current version): [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/ccmoondaoconstitution) \n* Website: [https://ccmoons.com/](https://ccmoons.com/) \n* rCryptoCurrency Advertising FAQ: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P\\_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGjm3P_khN29cu1OjyYbS8LcCM-rTvEfAuieSHrpvlc/edit?tab=t.0) \n* Governance: [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth) \n* Advertising Pitch Deck: [https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck](https://docsend.com/v/xqhb9/rccpitchdeck) \n* Transparency Report: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\nCurrent DAO Officers:  \nExecutive Director: u/002_timmy  \nTreasurer: u/jwinterm  \nSecretary: u/MaeronTargaryen  \nMarketing Officer: u/mvea  \nModeration Officer: u/CryptoMaximalist  \nTechnology &amp; Infrastructure Officer: u/rickribera93  \nCommunity Engagement Officer: Vacant  \nEcosystem Growth Officer: Vacant\n\n# 2. Treasury Overview\n\nAs of October 30, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $71,370 in total value.  \nThe last update on October 13 reported a treasury value of $76,865. While total value has decreased by roughly $5,495, the non-Moon portion of the treasury has increased by about $610, and the stablecoin portion (USDC, USDT, USDC.E) has increased by approximately $1,224. This reflects real growth in liquid assets despite the price decline in Moons.\n\nTreasury Holdings:\n\n|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Moons|848,192|$62,618|\n|ETH|0.83683|$3,105|\n|USDC|3,337|$3,337|\n|USDT|1,301|$1,301|\n|ARB|1,848|$521|\n|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|\n\nNon-Moon value: approximately $8,750  \nChange since last update: +$610 non-Moon value (+$1,224 in stablecoins)\n\n# 3. Burn Summary\n\nTotal and change since October 13 update -\n\nArbitrum One: 1,037,977 Moons burned (+16,616)  \nArbitrum Nova: 3,132,254 Moons burned (+10)  \nTotal burned: 4,170,231 Moons (+16,626)\n\nThese burns continue to demonstrate healthy advertising and partner activity across the DAO’s integrated platforms.\n\n# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)\n\nDAO-Owned Liquidity is held in the USDC–MOON pool on Uniswap.\n\nUniswap Pool: [https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650](https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650)  \nWallet for tracking: 0x33D549e99bae2Ff38cA1AdB280f77151C86E1b3c\n\nCurrent position value: $3,791  \nComposition: 29,210 Moons and 1,615 USDC\n\nFees earned since the last update: $21.13  \nMoon size since Oct 13: +6880 MOON   \nUSDC size since Oct 13: +733 USDC  \nTotal DOL growth since last report: +$964 in total value\n\nThe DAO moved from a v4 to v3 Uniswap pool to ensure integration compatibility with Teller. This pool is now the reference pricing source for many DeFi applications on Arbitrum and will continue to earn fees and reinvest them.\n\n# 5. Distribution Updates\n\nDistributions continue to follow the new 12-month revenue-based model approved in the previous update. Assuming no additional burns, approximately 4,000 Moons will be distributed each period.\n\nThe app used to claim Moons and poll rewards is currently offline due to AWS and Microsoft outages. The technical team is working with service providers to restore functionality and evaluating redundancies to prevent similar downtime in the future.\n\nWe are also exploring additional sponsorship-based distributions similar to the previous Polygon campaign that contributed $5,000 in POL tokens for subreddit users.\n\n# 6. Sponsorships and Partnerships\n\nRevenue received since October 13 totals approximately $5,000, with payments from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), and Polygon. These funds were allocated across burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity per the standard 25/25/25/25 split.\n\nUpcoming and active AMAs include Teller (live now), SurfAI, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), Pineapple, Trezor, and multiple Monad announcement posts and AMAs.\n\nTransparency and payment tracking are visible at:  \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE\\_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZVE_3DCbox2bfObBXvYcOZOMNw62l6bjZfGLD-g2rA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n\n# 7. Moons on Arbitrum One\n\nMax total supply: 9,668,157 MOON\n\nHolder distribution:  \nCamelot v3 pool – 1.8M (18.75%)  \nTeller supply – \\~1.5M (15.23%)  \nBurn address – 1.04M (10.74%)  \nDAO multisig treasury – 848K (8.77%)\n\nOver one-third of the total supply is now actively productive in DeFi pools, burned, or held in the treasury.  \nExcluding the burned supply, that rises to around 40%.  \nIf the DAO multisig is also excluded, nearly 45% of all circulating Moons on Arbitrum on are now engaged in active DeFi use cases.\n\n# 8. Governance and Upcoming Proposals\n\nTwo proposals are currently live on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta:\n\n1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.\n2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities to support Moon utility and development. \n\nBoth proposals are scheduled for a Moon Week 68 vote.\n\n# 9. Bridge Development\n\nThe DAO is exploring new bridging solutions to improve movement of Moons between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One. Current bridging options are limited and slow—most notably, the canonical Arbitrum bridge requires a six-and-a-half-day transfer period. We are reaching out to third-party bridge teams to create a faster and more user-friendly path between networks.\n\nUsers are encouraged to move Moons to Arbitrum One if they wish to participate in integrations like Teller and future DeFi partnerships, as Arbitrum One currently has broader ecosystem support.\n\n# 10. Future Plans\n\nThe DAO’s number one goal remains to complete legal registration as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize our status, protect contributors, and allow direct contracting with partners and advertisers.\n\nOther active initiatives include:  \n• Expanding DeFi utility for Moons via Teller and Uniswap integrations  \n• Pursuing grants to fund a DEX integration on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  \n• Building a faster cross-chain bridge for Nova to One liquidity  \n• Hosting recurring AMAs and live update streams to reach broader audiences beyond Reddit\n\nThat concludes the CCMOON DAO update for October 30, 2025.

Our goal is to allow users to supply single tokens and earn more of the *same* token with no dual-asset pairs, no impermanent loss, and no lockups.\n\nFor example, you supply $MOON, you earn more $MOON automatically -- Simple. No gimmicks.\n\n**How does Teller work?**\n\n* We initially launched our [rewards program on Base](https://blog.teller.org/earn-compounding-yield-on-base-tokens-with-teller/) and have now expanded it to other networks: you can supply and stake your favorite tokens on Teller to earn up to **22% APY** per block.\n* No lock-ups. You can withdraw anytime.\n* No impermanent loss, because the protocol doesn’t use AMM style liquidity pools for lending. Instead: peer-to-pool lending. Borrowers draw from a pool; lenders deposit; borrowers repay interest.\n* As borrowing demand rises, the APY can go higher (ranging from 20-60%) because yield comes from borrower interest payments + our incentive program.\n* Once liquidity in a pool hits $100K, expect the incentive portion to gradually decline, with the organic borrowing interest taking over more of the yield burden.\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\n* For token holders: you can hold a token you believe in, deposit it, and earn more of that same token, rather than converting into something else and dealing with pairs or LP tokens.\n* For risk control: because you're supplying single assets and there's no AMM, you avoid impermanent loss (which happens when you provide LP tokens and the relative price of the assets changes).\n* Transparent incentives: We’ve laid out how the yield is constructed (incentive side + borrower interest side) so users can understand what they’re participating in.\n\n**What are the risks?**\n\n* Lending always has default risk — borrowers might not repay. The protocol isolates pools by token to reduce cross-token risk. If a borrower does default then the collateral is put up on an onchain dutch auction, sold, and then returned to the pool.\n* Liquidity risk: While the protocol allows withdrawal anytime, if a large part of the liquidity is borrowed, there could be constraints (or interest rates might go up).\n* Token risk: Because you’re holding a token, you’re exposed to price volatility of that asset (even though there's no impermanent loss).\n* There is always contract risk, as with any protocol. However, Teller is 3 years old, has been audited 3 times, and uses Hypernative to protect against reentrancy attacks.\n\n**Holding $MOON?**\n\nThere is currently over 1% of the $MOON supply staked on Teller!\n\nYou can now supply and stake your MOONs to start earning more MOONs.\n\nSee the image below for an example of how much you can earn:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/np0gxios1byf1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7e011c5d2c53fa1cfe75092234286e251eeec0\n\n\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/ama-teller-launches-rewards-program-earn-22-compounding-v0-j7ktwmji0byf1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7003ebfd53a6d4a4ecbc485c1c2d0543c5525db6)\n\n**How you can start earning:**\n\nStep 1: Go to [app.teller.org](https://t.co/Qi6U79QY9X)\n\nStep 2: Connect your wallet \n\nStep 3: Select your network\n\nStep 4: Select a lending pool \n\nStep 5: Supply + Stake your tokens and start earning 22% yield\n\n\n\n**Ask us anything!**", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 71, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oka1vr/ama_teller_launches_rewards_program_earn_22/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1ojuslv", "author": "aminok", "handle": "aminok", "created_utc": 1761815501.0, "text": "Universal Cross Margin — How Lighter Plans to Turn Every Ethereum Asset into Trading Collateral Lighter is introducing **Universal Cross Margin (UCM)** — a system that could make *any* Ethereum-based asset usable as margin collateral for perpetual trading. That includes ETH, stETH, LP tokens, Aave positions, or WBTC — not just stablecoins like USDC. The assets stay on Ethereum Layer 1, continuing to earn yield, while traders open and manage positions on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nThe key innovation here is that this cross-layer collateralization is **fully verifiable through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs**, not bridges, oracles, or multisig custodians. Earlier systems couldn’t do this because ZK tech wasn’t mature enough to efficiently prove complex financial state changes (like order matching, margin calls, and liquidations) at scale. Lighter built custom ZK circuits and a specialized “Order Book Tree” that make it computationally feasible to verify every operation — including those involving collateral that never leaves Ethereum.\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Collateral stays on Ethereum (L1)** You lock ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or other supported assets into Lighter’s L1 smart contracts. They remain on Ethereum, keeping their native yield (e.g. stETH still earns staking rewards).\n2. **Collateral is registered in the L2 state** Lighter’s rollup records the locked asset in its state tree so it can be used for trading margin. The L2 handles execution through a low-latency sequencer and proves every transaction with ZK circuits.\n3. **Trading happens on L2** Orders are matched on a central-limit order book. You can trade any listed pair using the collateral value of your L1 assets. None of your assets move unless you’re liquidated.\n4. **Liquidations and settlements are cryptographically enforced** If a position becomes under-collateralized, the L2 generates a ZK proof of the liquidation event. That proof is submitted to Lighter’s Ethereum contract, which verifies it and automatically releases only the required portion of the locked collateral. No human intervention, no trust assumptions.\n5. **Full composability with DeFi** Because assets remain on Ethereum, they can still interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem — earning yield or being tokenized for use elsewhere. The same logic applies in reverse: DeFi positions can serve as margin on Lighter.\n\n# Why It’s Different\n\nPrevious perpetual DEXs and L1 derivatives platforms faced trade-offs:\n\n* **Bridges and oracles** introduced trust and delay (often hacked or manipulated).\n* **Monolithic alt-L1s** like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid had to rebuild their own ecosystems, isolating liquidity.\n* **Optimistic rollups** could not liquidate in real time due to challenge periods.\n* **ZK rollups** before now couldn’t efficiently prove multi-asset financial logic.\n\nLighter’s architecture removes these limits. Cross-margining multiple DeFi assets becomes **provably safe** — verifiable on Ethereum with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n# Why It Matters\n\n* **Capital efficiency:** traders can use yield-earning assets without selling or wrapping them.\n* **Security:** all collateral and state roots are settled on Ethereum; nothing depends on a bridge.\n* **Verifiability:** every trade, liquidation, and collateral adjustment is backed by a ZK proof.\n* **Integration:** native composability with Ethereum means Lighter can plug into existing DeFi protocols instead of competing with them.\n\nIf it works as described, UCM could shift on-chain trading from isolated collateral systems to a **capital-agnostic model**, where any Ethereum asset can serve as trustless margin — something earlier generations of DeFi simply couldn’t do.\n\n# Sources\n\nLighter whitepaper (October 2025) — discusses the core architecture, Order Book Tree, ZK-proof system and collateral logic. - [https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf](https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nInterview on the Bankless podcast with founder Vladimir Novakovski — confirms the roadmap including Universal Cross Margin and the ZKVM sidecar. - [https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex](https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ojuslv/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

For the first time in several years, the story, the data, and the execution all align. POL’s market capitalization grew 39.2% quarter over quarter to $2.36 billion dollars, outperforming the broader crypto market, which rose by 20%. Network activity, institutional participation, and technical upgrades all moved forward in sync.\n\nWhat excites me most about this report is that it validates what many of us who follow Polygon closely have been sensing. After a few years of searching for direction, Polygon has rediscovered its identity and is executing with focus. The growth across payments, real-world assets, and interoperability shows a network building for real adoption rather than temporary hype.\n\nHistory Lesson - Polygon was one of the most prominent blockchains during 2021 and 2022. Back then, MATIC was a household name in crypto. DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and gaming applications all flocked to Polygon. It was fast, cheap, and part of Ethereum’s scaling future.\n\nThen the market cooled, prices dropped, and Polygon’s identity blurred. It continued shipping technology, but the narrative was less defined. The ecosystem became large, but scattered, and the token’s performance reflected that uncertainty.\n\nIn 2025, that changed. Polygon refocused around two themes with real-world traction: payments and real-world assets. This focus unified its ecosystem under one clear goal of building the financial and transactional backbone for onchain economies. The Messari data shows that this strategy is working. Stablecoin growth, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure upgrades are moving together.\n\nThe chain has a strong foundation and a clear direction. The 39% market-cap surge in Q3 is the first tangible signal that the market recognizes that turnaround. To me, it feels like the beginning of Polygon’s second act.\n\nThe market performance in Q3 represents renewed confidence in execution. POL now ranks as the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 token by market capitalization, behind Mantle and ahead of Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. More than 99% of the supply has transitioned from MATIC to POL, completing one of the largest token migrations in the industry.\n\nPolygon’s outperformance is supported by onchain metrics. Daily active addresses increased by 13%, daily transactions rose 20%, and the average transaction fee declined by 23% in POL terms. These metrics indicate expanding usage and improving efficiency at the same time.\n\nWhen I look at these numbers, I see a market beginning to price real fundamentals again. The price action is following execution, which is what sustainable growth looks like.\n\nPolygon’s payments ecosystem is one of the strongest indicators of real adoption. In Q3, stablecoin supply increased 22% to $2.94 billion. USDT alone grew 35% to $1.4B, while USDC maintained close to $1B.\n\nMore importantly, those stablecoins are being used. Payments-focused applications on Polygon facilitated $1.82B in transaction volume across more than 50 platforms during the quarter, up 49% from Q2.\n\nPolygon has also become a hub for innovative payments infrastructure. What excites me most about this growth is that it represents genuine economic activity. They are transfers, purchases, and settlements happening on a scalable blockchain that costs a fraction of a cent per transaction. This is what a functional onchain payments network looks like.\n\nIf payments show real consumer traction, real-world assets show that institutions are taking Polygon seriously. The total value of tokenized RWAs on Polygon reached $1.14B (recently grew to $1.6B last week) by the end of Q3. The issuers include government agencies, state banks, and regulated financial entities.\n\nGermany’s NRW Bank issued a 100 million euro bond on Polygon under electronic securities law. Spain’s BeToken launched one of Europe’s first fully regulated equity token offerings. The Philippines Department of Budget and Management implemented a blockchain-based system to track public funds, improving transparency in government spending. Justoken launched tokens backed by physical commodities such as soybeans and soybean oil, with a combined value of over $450M.\n\nThese projects mark a shift from experimentation to production. Institutions are using Polygon for financial instruments that carry legal and regulatory weight. This is the kind of adoption that builds long-term credibility. When state banks and government agencies issue assets on a public chain, it changes the perception of blockchain entirely.\n\nFor me, this is one of the most exciting parts of the Polygon story in 2025. Real capital is entering the ecosystem, and it is doing so on Polygon because of its reliability, low cost, and Ethereum alignment.\n\nWhile institutional adoption is accelerating, developer momentum has been equally strong. Polygon ranks fourth in global blockchain developer interest in 2025, behind Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. This shows that the ecosystem continues to attract new builders even as competition increases.\n\nThe Agglayer Incubator Program has become a central piece of this growth. The Agglayer connects multiple chains into a unified liquidity network, creating an environment where assets and users move seamlessly between ecosystems. \n\nSeveral breakout projects have emerged from this initiative. Katana, a DeFi-optimized Layer 2 chain, launched earlier this year with deep liquidity and sustainable yield mechanisms. Miden continues to advance zero-knowledge virtual machine research. Billions focuses on institutional DeFi infrastructure, while other projects explore areas such as onchain identity and privacy.\n\nThis expanding network of independent but interoperable chains is what sets Polygon apart in 2025. It is not competing to be a single chain; it is building an interconnected ecosystem under the Agglayer framework.\n\nPolygon’s resurgence is also visible in its community engagement. **On October 1, 2025, Polygon became the first blockchain to formally sponsor and participate in** r/CryptoCurrency **as a Community Sponsor.** They are officially a sponsor of this subreddit and have distributed $5000 in POL rewards to users of the sub.\n\nAccording to Surf AI’s (another AMA participant) sentiment analysis, Polygon leads all Layer 2 solutions in positive Reddit discussions, with 78 percent bullish mentions compared to 62 percent for competitors. This shows that sentiment around Polygon has turned positive again as users see progress across the ecosystem.\n\nThe renewed focus on education and open communication reflects Polygon’s effort to focusing meaningfully in crypto communities and cultures. I view this community alignment as a strong sign of maturity.\n\nSeveral major developments this quarter have strengthened Polygon’s position further.\n\n* **Institutional Staking:** AMINA Bank launched regulated POL staking on October 9, 2025, offering compliant yield opportunities for institutional investors. This could unlock large amounts of capital from entities that have been waiting for regulatory clarity.\n* **Polymarket Expansion:** Polymarket, one of the most active applications on Polygon, saw its trading volume increase tenfold year over year in 2025. It now represents a significant share of Polygon’s DeFi activity and recently completed a $2B raise at a $9B valuation.\n* **Developer and Institutional Leadership:** Polygon continues to attract developers and enterprises alike through programs such as the Agglayer Incubator.\n* **Vitalik Buterin’s Endorsement:** In mid-October 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly praised Polygon’s contributions to Ethereum scalability and its early leadership in zero-knowledge research.\n\nOne of the most exciting developments this week is Polygon Labs’ collaboration with Manifold Trading, a quantitative investment firm specializing in institutional-grade liquidity. This partnership represents a major leap toward professional market standards in decentralized finance.\n\nManifold will bring data-driven liquidity management, quantitative market-making, and tighter spreads to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. In traditional markets, firms like Manifold ensure smooth execution and consistent pricing across venues. That structure has largely been missing in DeFi, where liquidity often sits idle or fragmented across decentralized exchanges.\n\nBy applying institutional execution practices to onchain markets, Polygon and Manifold are building a system that offers predictable depth and lower slippage. For context, compressing the spread on a one-million-dollar trade from 50 basis points to 5 basis points can save more than 4,000 dollars in execution costs. Scaled across billions in trading volume, these efficiencies make DeFi truly investable at institutional scale.\n\nManifold’s strategies will operate across Polygon’s major decentralized exchanges to harmonize pricing and ensure new markets launch with meaningful depth from day one.\n\nFor fintechs and neobanks exploring onchain payments or tokenized asset trading, the benefits are immediate. Polygon’s network can now deliver the execution quality and stability of traditional financial systems while maintaining the transparency and openness of DeFi.\n\nThis is a direct extension of the vision Polygon has been building toward all year. With infrastructure capable of 5,000-plus transactions per second, sub-five-second finality, and unified cross-chain liquidity through the Agglayer, the network is becoming a full-stack solution for global payments and institutional finance. The Manifold partnership makes that vision tangible by turning liquidity itself into an institutional-grade product.\n\nPolygon’s infrastructure progress has been equally important. The Bhilai Hardfork, Heimdall v2, and Rio Testnet upgrades have all delivered major performance improvements.\n\nThe Bhilai Hardfork increased throughput to over 1,000 transactions per second, raised the block gas limit, and implemented account abstraction through EIP-7702. Heimdall v2 reduced transaction finality from one to two minutes down to approximately five seconds by upgrading the consensus layer. The Rio Testnet, which is moving toward mainnet, introduces stateless verification and validator redesigns that could enable up to 5,000 transactions per second.\n\nPolygon also launched Agglayer CDK Enterprise, a toolkit that allows institutions to deploy privacy-enabled EVM chains that remain interoperable with the main ecosystem. This combination of scalability, privacy, and interoperability is a major step toward institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAverage transaction fees have dropped to roughly 0.0027 dollars, making Polygon one of the most efficient networks in the space. For payments and RWAs, those economics are critical.\n\nPolygon’s 2025 story is one of renewal. The network has moved from a period of uncertainty to a position of clear strength. Its focus on payments, real-world assets, and interoperability has created measurable growth across both retail and institutional segments.\n\nThe community is re-engaged, the developer base is expanding, and institutions are beginning to trust Polygon for real financial applications. The Messari report captures this turning point with data, but the larger narrative is about execution and focus.\n\nThe 39% rise in market capitalization in Q3 is, in my view, only an early indication of what lies ahead. Polygon has rebuilt its foundation, aligned its strategy with real demand, and positioned itself at the center of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Polygon could become one of the most important networks in the next phase of blockchain adoption.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 24, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oil6xd/polygon_has_supported_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_im/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie.\n\nContext matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters.\n\nThe bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades.\n\nOne interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end.\n\nMy read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon. The question isn’t “did it pop today?” It’s “does it keep showing up on statements for the next six earnings calls?” Anyone else feeling that shift… from hype cycles to slow, boring normalization?", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 10, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oikeeb/solana_etf_goes_live_but_the_vibes_feel_different/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The talk is sufficiently laymen. It's worth paying attention to the accelerating timeline, his reasons for why NIST's deadline is too late, and his encouragement to stop acting dismissively.\n\nI liked his remark about IBM never having missed a deadline, and how he uses IBM's timeline as the most conservative estimate, which is ahead of NIST's deadline. IonQ timeline is way ahed of NIST's deadline.\n\nI also liked that he spelt it out: those acting dismissively have invariably never had any real understanding of quantum computing.\n\nIn the meantime, keep buying Bitcoin.\n\nEDIT: A good review of the current (Sep 2025) post-quantum migration landscape for a few major blockchains, including ECDSA based ones (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) and EdDSA ones (Solana, Sui, Aptos, etc), is: *\"Post-Quantum Blockchain: Transition Landscape Amidst Evolving Complexity\"* https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1626 (thanks u/Tsmacks1 for the pointer). Some of the references in there are also good reads.\n\nCrypto bros have traditionally dismissed it all and also claimed \"The world will have much bigger problems if RSA or ECC is cracked.\" which is funny when you think about it, because out of all the big &amp; high stake systems you could attack,  a crypto network would likely be one of the first, simply because attacking other big &amp; high stake systems has a higher risk of sending you to jail. In other words, the other big systems have an inherent higher level of protection.\n\nThe problem of \"lost\" coins is a big one, as those aren't protected. People no longer in control of private keys (lost, dead, etc) will not be able to upgrade, so their coins will be available to crackers. Devs can theoretically block those addresses but that's a big pandora's box and I don't see it happening in Bitcoin as it would undermine the whole thesis of \"nobody controls Bitcoin\" (plus devs don't actually know if an address is dead). They possibly could add functionality to the chain such that a quantum private key derived from a classic key can unlock the funds, giving the true owner a bit of time to claim their coins before crackers get to it.\n\nLost coins have no legislation protecting them. If you crack it, it's yours. Cracking equipment at first will only be available to QC manufacturers themselves, then big corps, then governments, before organized crime and smaller crime can afford/get their hands on it. Who wouldn't want Satoshi's stash?\n\n*P.S. Bitcoin MODs: you're hurting your own community, and your message to me says more about you. Banning me from r/Bitcoin for posting this video with \"you're obviously not here to learn about bitcoin\" is ironic, given the video is meant to help people learn.

They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.\n\nFed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms.

This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.\n\nWhy Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment.\n\nWhat’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti.

I have to admit, I'm kind of a fan of PAXG.  PAXG if you don't know is an ERC-20 coin soft-pegged to gold.  I've held it for quite a while as my long term flight to safety when not actively trading.  That kind of worked out in my favor recently.  I'm glad I wasn't trading.\n\nI'll tell you what I don't like about it.  Pretty expensive to move around.  We are talking like $3.  Now in the grand scheme of things that's tiny.  But what I mean by this is I wish it wasn't just a decent value store.  I wish it was transactable.\n\nNow this is where I'm going to date how up to date my knowledge is.  Not very.  I nerded out on crypto quite a while ago and then didn't keep up.  Hence the question.\n\nIn theory there are wrappers that could make it transactable.  Probably more wrappers than an old hat like me could keep track of.  The question is what would actually be good?  I know polygon, solana, and avalanche are used to wrap things.  No matter what is picked there can be more that one route to actual funding.  One could do a bridge that would incur the high paxg fees at least.  One could exchange it on a dex.  But then you have to find a dex that has decent activity for what is fairly obscure.  I would argue it shouldn't be.  I wish wrapped PAXG was a common coin.\n\nThat's why it's worth asking the new hats.  I probably sound like I know more than I do.  I'm a technical dude but with the last few years of crypto I've mostly just kept up with vocab.  That's a pretty shallow level of understanding.  I'm confident in my technical abilities enough to admit when my understanding is shallow in an area.\n\nI do think gold is going to keep going up long term.  And the demand for exchange in gold is going to go up even faster than that.  The perceived future demand for gold based transaction is leading the price.  I also think that crypto is about to hit another period of significant volatility, more so than recent.  In what direction I don't know, but I fear it might be down.  More institutions that need to exchange real value are having to do it more often as they are being confronted with the real-politik of the current era.\n\nWe are now in an era of massive transition.  We think AI is causing a lot of transition in our lives but these transitions aren't isolated to us.  Some of the most core institutions are finding themselves in fast moving times compared to what they are used to.  Their standard rate of change is usually akin to molasses or pitch.  We have fiat currencies coming out of existence, like the Argentine peso, and CBDC being attempted, BRICS trying to be a thing, state sponsored resource competition to get the hardware setup for AI, and proxy conflicts between major powers.  And these institutions need to exchange real value when they make changes at the lowest level.  Just like we can exchange on-chain and off-chain, institutions have on-chain and off-chain.  And they have more demand to do more on-chain activity than they have in the past or think that they may need to do on-chain activity in the near future.  And on-chain for them is gold.\n\nMeanwhile on the consumer end, with attempts to create CBDC, many are going to want to prefer solutions they own to do the same thing.  People are going to want to do fast and convenient crypto.  And they are going to want to do it with more stability with something people recognize as having value and governments and institutions recognize as having value being a bonus.  And as mentioned before governments and institutions will very much be recognizing gold.\n\nAn era of gold may be upon us, if we want it.  If we can only get the transactability working smooth.  So let's figure it out.  Let's figure out what we are doing and what the standard is to move gold from phone to phone as fast as possible with the lowest fees.  The more of us that know what that standard is the more of us can do it and lead that standard.  This can be a good foot wedged in door alternative to CBDC.  And if we move fast and get that food in the door quickly we can keep the world crypto and free instead of CBDC and controlled.  It also may be harder for government to fight it economically if it exchanges something they themselves need to recognize.\n\nSo back to the technical side.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1o8gnmj", "author": "vantage7", "handle": "vantage7", "created_utc": 1760644986.0, "text": "Pyth Network Industries I was talking to AI about what future the Pyth Network could hold after partnering with Kalshi and AI got me thinking after this response.\n\nPyth Network’s ultra-low latency oracle infrastructure, capable of delivering price and event data updates in milliseconds, uniquely positions it to transform multiple industries that rely on real-time external data. Traditionally concentrated in decentralized finance (DeFi), Pyth’s technology now has cross-industry potential across sectors requiring rapid, reliable, and verifiable data delivery. Here’s how Pyth can tap into key industries:\n\n\nFinancial Services and Trading:\n\nPyth’s origins and strengths lie in finance, where millisecond-level price feed speed is critical. High-frequency trading firms and market makers depend on instantaneous market data to exploit arbitrage opportunities and hedge risks. DeFi protocols—decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and derivatives markets—require real-time prices to execute trades, maintain liquidity, and trigger liquidations fairly. Pyth’s direct connection to institutional data sources gives it an edge in security, accuracy, and speed, offering a critical infrastructure for on-chain financial products to operate with traditional capital market-grade data quality and speed.\n\nGaming and Esports:\n\nThe blockchain gaming and esports industries increasingly integrate tokenized assets, NFTs, and betting mechanisms that require timely data for fairness and user experience. Pyth’s millisecond data updates enable live odds, event outcomes, and in-game asset valuations to reflect real-world changes instantly. This creates a more immersive and trustworthy ecosystem for gamers and betters by preventing stale or manipulated data from impacting outcomes. The speed and tamper-resistant nature of Pyth’s oracles can underpin transparent, decentralized gaming marketplaces and prediction platforms.\nSupply Chain and Logistics\nModern supply chains leverage IoT sensors and smart contracts to monitor inventory, shipments, and environmental factors. Pyth’s rapid data transmission can enhance supply chain responsiveness by feeding real-time sensor data on location, temperature, or humidity directly into smart contracts. This enables automated decision-making such as rerouting shipments, activating contractual penalties for delays, or adjusting inventory levels dynamically. By incorporating Pyth’s oracle network, supply chain platforms can achieve greater transparency and efficiency in global trade flows.\n\nEnergy and Utilities:\n\nEnergy grids need to balance supply and demand continuously, a task made more complex by renewables like solar and wind that fluctuate rapidly. Pyth could provide low-latency weather data and sensor feeds to grid operators, enabling real-time adjustments in generation and distribution. This helps mitigate blackouts, optimize renewable usage, and integrate decentralized energy sources. The transparency and auditability of blockchain combined with Pyth’s fast oracles could also improve market operations in energy trading and decentralized utilities.\n\nSports Betting and Prediction Markets:\n\nIn sports betting and prediction markets, millisecond updates on event data, player stats, and odds determine fair pricing and reduce arbitrage risks. Pyth’s ability to deliver trusted, direct data feeds on-chain rapidly can revolutionize decentralized sports betting with fairer markets and real-time odds adjustments. This benefits both operators and bettors with enhanced market efficiency and reduced risk of manipulation or stale information.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles and IoT:\n\nThe emerging autonomous vehicle industry and IoT ecosystems require real-time sensor and environmental data to operate safely and efficiently. Pyth’s low-latency oracle feeds could deliver verifiable external inputs such as traffic data, weather conditions, and enterprise asset status directly to control systems or smart contracts managing automated processes. This would improve safety, reduce latency in decision-making, and create more efficient operational frameworks.\n\nIn conclusion, Pyth Network’s millisecond-level price and event data feeds provide a strong foundation for transforming a broad range of industries beyond DeFi. Its unique combination of speed, accuracy, security, and decentralized governance equips it to support new classes of applications that demand timely, reliable data integration. By tapping into finance, gaming, logistics, energy, betting, and IoT, Pyth can enable innovative business models, improved operational efficiencies, and greater transparency across sectors reliant on real-world data.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o8gnmj/pyth_network_industries/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

You can see it in how capital is moving right now.

The momentum highlights growing institutional confidence and sustained interest in regulated crypto investment vehicles.\n\nThe surge builds on a massive $5.95 billion inflow recorded just last week, one of the largest weekly totals ever.

As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn’t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they’re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) – Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) – Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) – Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the “revenue” comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don’t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it’s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there’s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that’s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There’s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem’s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK &amp; Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.", "lang": null, "likes": 4, "replies": 14, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0s90f/deep_dive_into_nonbtc_dats/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients’ addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don’t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 17, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs.

With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 20, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Traders shouldn’t need ten tabs open to trade, stake, learn, or find the next opportunity, and projects shouldn’t need to juggle launchpads, DEXs, and bots to grow. Pineapple brings it all together in one connected ecosystem designed for the next billion on-chain users.\n\nWe last joined you for an AMA months ago - and it’s safe to say a lot has changed since then. Since then, we’ve:\n\n• Launched PineappleDEX Lite, and now rolled out the full PineappleDEX with CEX-grade limit orders\n\n• Continued to develop $PAPPLE utility, with stakers able to earn up to 15% APY, access to new token launches, and exclusive events. And soon, you’ll be able to spend $PAPPLE at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide\n\n• Integrated Solana, joining BNB, Ethereum, and Base, with many more chains to come\n\n• Opened Pineapple Mansion: our members-only ecosystem where top-tier stakers gain exclusive access to AMAs, private events, and luxury perks\n\n• Announced the first project launching through Pineapple Express (our community-first incubation and launchpad platform): a Harvard-backed team building the future of decentralized healthcare. Full details coming this Friday!\n\n• Partnered with Aaron Ramsey, ex-Arsenal, Juventus, and Welsh national team footballer with a global audience exceeding 2 billion across his channels and partnerships\n\n• Became the official exchange partner of Polaris, the fastest-growing combat sports league with hundreds of millions of viewers annually, and a presence on UFC Fight Pass\n\n• Brought on almost a dozen Conor McGregor-backed BKFC fighters as ambassadors, and even hosted a private yacht event for our top stakers and whales.\n\nWe’ve been called one of the most active and innovative teams in DeFi - not just in product delivery, but in partnerships, marketing, and community building.\n\nNow, we’re here to share what’s next - and trust me, there’s a lot just around the corner. From real-world assets and AI-powered trading, to new launchpad projects and global partnerships, the next phase of Pineapple is built to redefine how DeFi feels, functions, and grows.\n\nAMA Details:\n\n🗓 Questions open: Monday, October 6\n\n💬 Answers posted: Tuesday/Wednesday, October 7-8\n\n💰 Rewards: 25,000 $PAPPLE split among the best questions\n\nAsk me anything - from new product updates, partnerships, and $PAPPLE utility to our upcoming launches and long-term DeFi vision.\nJoin us to learn about some of the most exciting developments in DeFi just around the corner.", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 91, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nzmzej/ama_with_pineapple_bringing_defi_to_the_masses/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Keep it in CRO or convert to BTC/other coins? Hey everyone, I’m curious how you manage your [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card cashback. Do you just keep it in CRO and let it accumulate, or do you regularly swap it into something else like BTC, ETH, or a stablecoin?\n\nI’ve noticed opinions vary a lot: some people say CRO has long-term potential and it’s worth holding for the staking rewards or the ecosystem benefits (like the card tiers, DeFi wallet, and Cronos chain). Others treat it purely as a cashback token and immediately convert it to Bitcoin or another asset with stronger fundamentals.\n\nPersonally, I’m torn. On one hand, it’s nice to let the CRO stack grow since it’s basically “free money,” but on the other, the price fluctuations can be wild, and I’m not sure I want too much exposure to a single platform token.\n\nHow do you guys handle it? Do you see CRO as a hold, or do you dump it as soon as you get it?

I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here’s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50–60% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about “supply shock” and “institutional demand.” Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the “smart money” and the “supply shock” narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that’s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that’s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn’t disappeared. It’s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that “the macro environment is too tough” doesn’t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn’t (only) the economy, it’s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That’s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and “institutional adoption” story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every “strong project” will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn’t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, “Is this really it?”\n\nIf ETH and alts don’t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won’t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto’s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic “BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; alts” rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don’t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "lang": null, "likes": 624, "replies": 579, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve been kicking this idea around for a while: if you were to launch your own crypto project from scratch, what would you actually do to give the coin real market value and not just pump-and-dump hype?\n\nMost new coins seem to follow the same tired playbook: spin up a catchy name, throw together a whitepaper, raise some money, list on a few DEXes, hope for a pump on Twitter, and then watch interest fade after a few weeks. That’s obviously not sustainable. I’m curious about the people here who think about the long game.\n\nIf you were in charge, how would you approach it? Would you focus on:\n\nUtility: A lot of coins die because they don’t do anything useful. Would you design it around a specific problem, maybe payments, gaming, privacy, DeFi, or something entirely different?\n\nTokenomics: Would you prioritize fair distribution, low inflation, or something like a burn mechanism to control supply? Maybe staking rewards to keep holders engaged?\n\nLiquidity &amp; Listings: We all know exchange access matters. Would you try to get on every CEX you can early on, or focus on building liquidity pools on DeFi first?\n\nCommunity: Some projects live or die by their community. Would you prioritize building an engaged user base first, think memes, community voting, regular updates or do you think community only matters once there’s actual utility?\n\nPartnerships &amp; Real-World Use: This is where I see a lot of coins fall short. Beyond airdrops and influencer shilling, what about partnerships with businesses or apps where the coin could actually be used?\n\nMarketing vs. Building: The classic debate: do you spend early energy on marketing hype to get people in the door, or quietly build and launch with a working product before going loud?\n\nPersonally, I think too many projects skip over the fundamentals. Everyone wants a moonshot chart, but few want to do the boring work: sustainable tokenomics, real-world use cases, proper liquidity strategy, and a solid long-term plan for how the token integrates into whatever ecosystem you’re building.\n\nSo I’m throwing it out to the community: if you were given the chance to create a new crypto from zero, how would you try to make it valuable over the next 5+ years?\n\nWhat’s the first thing you’d focus on?\nWhat’s the mistake you’d avoid at all costs?\nAny unconventional tactics that you think could really move the needle?", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 40, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwmddc/if_you_started_your_own_crypto_project_how_would/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Memecoins… I know what you’re probably thinking when you read that word. And yes, most of your preconceptions are correct. A large portion of this industry, especially when you consider the capital involved, revolves around pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nIn fact, I recently came across more than one confession on Reddit from self-proclaimed pump-and-dump operators. From organized KOL gangs to small-time celebrities, and even highly technical individuals with automated toolkits — most of them operate on Solana. And the majority use the **Pump\\[dot\\]fun** platform.\n\nOne Reddit user in particular, u/JewelTamexJuno, caught my attention because of the level of detail he revealed during an AMA. He also seemed to have a thinly veiled agenda of selling his own toolkit, which he described as including:\n\n* Volume bot\n* X tracker\n* AI API with his own LLM\n* Private RPC (likely a rented dedicated node)\n* New trader alert bot\n* Sniper bot\n\nAs anyone familiar with web3 will notice, none of this is groundbreaking. Some tools are even free or easy to adapt. Others cost just a few dollars. With less than $100, anyone could piece together a similar setup, even without coding skills — with a bit of effort, of course.\n\nHe even outlined his script, which goes something like this:\n\n* X trackers monitor large accounts (e.g., Elon, Presidents, major CT figures).\n* An account tweets an image (for example, Elon Musk posting a Doge on the moon).\n* His bot detects the image and instantly creates a memecoin around it, with AI generating the name.\n* He buys a chunk of the supply and runs volume bots.\n* Retail traders jump in.\n* He dumps.\n\nHe also dropped this gem of his wisdom:\n\n“*Everyone knows that newly created coins based on trends can rug at any time, making it a race for manual traders.*”\n\nThis is a snapshot of how one individual can manipulate the system — not because he’s a genius, but because the entire environment makes it possible. Beyond individuals, I also saw mob-like operations involving KOLs running secret Telegram groups, coordinating manual pumps, and creating ponzi-like subgroup structures where insiders grabbed the biggest slice. Again, not sophisticated — just organized extraction.\n\nAnd let’s not even start with celebrities and nation-state presidents orchestrating their own pump-and-dumps. We’ve seen enough to understand that the **Solana ecosystem is saturated with mafia-style groups and bot armies**, all dressed up as “fun” memecoins.\n\nBut are people really having fun? Is there anything authentic to this narrative, or is it just another layer of extractive nonsense?\n\n\\[This is small part of my article \"[Are you laughing?](https://substack.com/home/post/p-175103381) [The way to have fun with memecoins like a builder](https://substack.com/inbox/post/175103381?r=23szg&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&amp;triedRedirect=true)\" just click the link if you want to read the full story and discover one or two new things, but i REALLY want to start a discussion here, it's not a engagement/subscriber farming post.

TVL is at all-time highs and new chains &amp; projects are emerging regularly. In this education post, I will be exploring incentive platforms that provide additional rewards beyond standard yield farming approaches and how users can compound rewards. These platforms assist protocols in bootstrapping liquidity through boosted incentives, points, or campaigns, offering users improved returns with minimal added risk.\n\nI will be examining Merkl, Fuul, and Turtle.\n\nThis is NFA and before allocating to these protocols, you should DYOR.\n\nI am not financially compensated from the 3 protocols and do not have official relationships with them, I simply have used the protocols and had good experiences.\n\nOne big piece of alpha: none of the platforms have launched a token yet, but we know so many platforms eventually do drop a token. Early participation may qualify users for potential airdrops or rewards before saturation occurs. Merkl, Fuul, and Turtle.xyz currently have no live tokens, though Turtle announced $TURTLE on September 29, 2025, with launch details forthcoming. Merkl and Fuul have not indicated tokens publicly, but DeFi platforms often reward early users retroactively and engaging prior to announcements when competition is lower can be advantageous.\n\nPlatforms like these can be extremely lucrative, especially Turtle.xyz, by stacking multiple reward layers on stable or low-risk positions. I am personally using Turtle.xyz before the airdrop, farming stablecoins on Katana.  Turtle has a liquidity leaderboard and is airdropping to the top 1000 on their liquidity leaderboard, which currently requires just over $500.  No idea how much this will be worth on TGE, but if you’re already yield farming on TAC, Katana, or Linea, might as well pick up some free rewards.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: There are liquidity farming, incentive-as-a-service platforms that add incentives to attract TVL and give users increased yields. Early use may yield benefits from future token drops.\n\n**Platform Overviews**\n\nThese function as incentives-as-a-service tools, enabling protocols to run targeted campaigns for liquidity attraction. Users deposit or provide liquidity, receiving base yields plus additional points or rewards. This aids chains and apps in bootstrapping without rapid emission depletion, while expanding user compounding options.\n\n* Merkl: Backed by a16z, Merkl is an incentive and points management platform for custom campaigns across over 50 chains. It has distributed more than $200M in incentives, with partners including Aave, Compound, Katana, Morpho, Uniswap, Euler, and PancakeSwap. Integrations on Arbitrum and Optimism facilitate stacking rewards on lending or LP positions.\n* Fuul: Fuul offers tools for incentive programs paid in points or tokens. It has generated over $4B in trading volume from dYdX referrals, plus contributions to Vertex (30% of early trading volume) and Resolv. Partners include dYdX, Vertex, Resolv, Dune, Base, and Arbitrum. It supports no-code campaigns for trading, lending, and liquidity provisioning.\n* **Turtle.xyz**: Turtle.xyz routes deposits to partners through campaigns and a leaderboard. It has handled over $5B in liquidity and accumulated a multi-million-dollar treasury from contributions. Deposits are straightforward, with $524 currently sufficient for top 1000 leaderboard placement. Partners include Linea, Katana, Lombard, Etherfi, Renzo, Scroll, TAC, and over 30 others such as PancakeSwap and Swell. For BTCfi users, LBTC deposits on Katana earn Lux Points, potentially qualifying for $BARD airdrops, so you can basically triple-dip here.\n\n**Significance for DeFi Users**\n\nIn a competitive environment, these platforms enhance efficiency by aligning incentives. Protocols are willing to pay to gain increased TVL for growth, while users receive amplified returns. This creates a sustainable ecosystem dynamic. With no tokens launched yet (except Turtle's upcoming one), current involvement offers opportunities for retrospective rewards.\n\nFor DeFi users, this trend indicates that projects and chains are increasingly willing to pay extra through boosted incentives and campaigns to attract users and liquidity. This ultimately benefits participants with higher yields and airdrop qualifications. Users win.  \n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this is that institutions are also engaging with these platforms. For example, Turtle.xyz has attracted institutional investors like Susquehanna International Group, signaling a broader shift in TradFi's openness to onchain activities and integration with DeFi.\n\nThese developments reflect DeFi's maturation, where sophisticated incentive layers allow users to stack rewards across multiple protocols and chains, democratizing access to opportunities that were once limited to large players. This fosters greater innovation and competition among ecosystems, as chains vie for capital with structured campaigns rather than relying on volatile token emissions. For everyday users, it means more ways to optimize portfolios and combine base APYs with points, leaderboards, and potential airdrops.  These potentially compounded gains in a low-effort manner leads to better and better rewards. As institutional adoption grows, it could further stabilize liquidity pools and introduce new asset classes, pointing to a more resilient and expansive DeFi landscape overall.\n\nAdoption is increasing as protocols integrate these tools. For those farming yields, incorporating them can elevate APYs.\n\n\n\nAgain, this isn’t meant as financial advice, but more highlighting how defi users can improve their yield and gains through these incentive-as-a-service liquidity providing platforms.", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nunyq2/defi_education_liquidity_coordination_platforms/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

I’ve been looking at how consistently profitable traders operate and a lot of them DCA instead of timing entries. Makes sense: you smooth volatility and remove emotion.\n\nExecution is the interesting part. Most people use Coinbase or Kraken recurring buys...simple, but fees/spreads can add up. I’ve been using Jupiter on Solana for on-chain DCA: set an interval and it routes across DEXs for best price. Way more flexible than most CEX options. Downside: you need to manage SOL for gas and on-chain failures/alerts.\n\nTax reality (US): buying crypto with fiat is not a taxable event. Weekly DCA creates lots of purchases to track for basis, but you don’t have a taxable event until you dispose (sell/trade/spend). On-chain, the gas you pay in SOL is a small taxable disposal of that SOL at its FMV when paid. That’s minor per tx, but real.\n\nBecause DCA multiplies transactions, crypto tax software isn’t optional once volume rises. You’ll want clean lot tracking (Specific ID/HIFO if you can substantiate, otherwise FIFO), fee roll-in to basis, and exports that won’t wreck your 8949 when you eventually sell.\n\nawaken.tax pulls your CEX and wallets, links internal transfers, applies your chosen lot method, and produces clean Form 8949 exports so your DCA doesn’t turn into spreadsheet purgatory at filing time.\n\nMy current setup: weekly BTC/ETH buys, bi-weekly SOL via Jupiter for alts. Took ~30 minutes to configure; then it runs.\n\nAnyone else running DCA? What cadence are you using, and are you staying on CEX for simplicity or going on-chain for flexibility?

I've spent some time exploring their docs, blogs, and setup. \n\nTL;DR - It's a Layer-1 project focused on privacy and post-quantum security. It's still early, but very reminiscent of other privacy coins that started out with limited buzz but interesting innovation. \n\n# What Neptune Cash Is All About\n\nAt its core, Neptune Cash is a peer-to-peer anonymous cash protocol built as a Layer-1 blockchain. It uses zk-STARKs integrated right at the base layer, which means users handle transaction proofs on their end, miners aggregate everything into one big block with a single proof. This keeps the chain succinct and scalable without bloating.\n\nThe standout for me is the privacy aspect. Transactions are fully anonymous by default, using mutator sets (a fresh approach to zero-knowledge that maintains privacy with full verifiability). It's designed for fungible cash-like transfers, and it also supports private smart contracts with arbitrary logic. This means it can be used in DeFi or apps and your portfolio stays hidden. \n\nCompared to something like Monero, which relies on ring signatures, this setup feels more efficient for scaling while keeping things untraceable. A\n\nFor post-quantum security, it is baked in from the start. All the cryptography is resistant to quantum attacks, meaning future upgrades or risks of a supply shock if quantum computers advance stay off the table. Neptune is quantum-secure at genesis, which is different than other projects where they would fix the quantum problem through forking the chain with the patch upgrades. This approach which positions Neptune for long-term usage in a world where privacy tech faces bigger threats down the line.\n\n# The Team Behind It\n\nAlan Szepieniec serves as the lead researcher. He holds a PhD in post-quantum cryptography from the University of Leuven in Belgium, works as a researcher at the Nervos Foundation, and founded AS Discrete Mathematics GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. He has authored numerous scientific papers, with key contributions including DARK/Supersonic (SNARKs without trusted setups using novel mathematics) and Rescue &amp; Rescue-Prime (hash functions widely adopted for zero-knowledge proofs). \n\nThorkil Værge is the other founder. He holds an MSc in Physics from the University of Copenhagen and brings over seven years of experience in blockchain technology. He has contributed to the specifications of the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin Lightning Network, built core blockchain implementations for companies like BitGo, Bitcoin Suisse, and Inacta, and created a compiler for specifying financial contracts on Ethereum.\n\nSuper a research-heavy team, with the project representing five years of dedicated R&amp;D. This project took a long time to ship, but personally, I appreciate the dedication to solid technical achievements.\n\n# Tokenomics and Mechanics\n\nToken is $NPT, with a total supply capped at 42 million – similar to Bitcoin's model but with tweaks. Halvings every three years, starting from 128 per block. Half of mining rewards are locked for three years, which aligns miners with long-term holding rather than quick actions. Premine is under 2%, and the design is deflationary over time.\n\nMining is Proof-of-Work, but memory-hard (needs about 40GB RAM for efficiency), which levels the field against botnets and ASICs. It got hit by a botnet early on (common issue for PoW chains), leading to a relaunch in August 2025 with the upgraded algo. Now it's more decentralized and resistant. If you're into mining, it's CPU/GPU friendly. The adoption is low and growing organically, like early privacy coins where miners were the first users.\n\n# Ways to participate\n\nAfter the AMA, I set up a node and wallet to poke around. Here's the practical side:\n\n* Wallet and Node: Download the core software from their GitHub (neptune-core). It's CLI-based for now – run commands to generate a wallet and sync the chain. Syncing is fast thanks to the recursive proofs; validating the whole history is basically instant.\n* Mining: If you want to try, install the core, configure your wallet, and point it at a pool or solo mine. Their docs cover it – it's straightforward if you're used to PoW setups. Usage is still early, but contributors are popping up because the tech is appealing for privacy-focused builds.\n* Acquiring $NPT: Only on SafeTrade right now (NPT-USDT pair). Liquidity is thin, so limit orders are key to avoid slippage. DEX is on the roadmap.\n* Resources: YouTube is great for explainers &amp; the explorer lets you view blocks without revealing privacy details.\n\nFrom what I've seen, adoption is in that bootstrapping phase. Usage starting with miners and devs but showing a lot of promise. Privacy and future-proofing are the core strengths, and it's worth exploring. I've learned a ton just setting it up.

Stablecoins and decentralized finance are experiencing another period of rapid expansion. In the last few months, new stablecoin issuance has added close to $25 billion to the market, with Tether (USDT) growing by about $18 billion and USD Coin (USDC) by $7 billion. This supply growth has coincided with an increase in decentralized borrowing models, particularly those based on Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs).\n\nOne example is Falcon Finance, which has launched the USDf stablecoin. Current figures show more than $1.8 billion in USDf circulating and $1.9 billion in total value locked (TVL). Like many DeFi projects, its focus is on transparency and asset security, which have become key concerns for users.\n\nMeanwhile, average daily transaction volumes in DeFi are reaching nearly $30 billion, up 15% month-over-month. This suggests that CDP-based systems and stablecoins are becoming more central to the overall ecosystem. We have also seen that top CEX like Bitget and the like of Bybit and MEXC often provide access to emerging assets early, which contributes to the visibility of these projects.\n\nDo you think we are witnessing the start of another DeFi cycle, or is this just a temporary surge?", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 14, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ns4msk/are_we_seeing_the_next_wave_of_defi_growth_fueled/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

A couple months ago, Teller ran AMA on this subreddit and since then it’s become one of the protocols I use the most.\n\nBullet points on features I like\n\n* TellerGPT – Amazing for DeFi users. I don't know why every platform doesn't do this. I get a daily email with live pool conditions, yields, and borrowing options. It saves me a ton of time since I don’t have to check every dashboard on the platoform and  can just scan my inbox and know where the best opportunities are.\n* Incentivized supply side yields – So I am a big time katana user. Right now I’m earning \\~25% APY on a couple assets (USDC &amp; POL) simply by supplying the asset. The rewards are in-kind which is also really nice and avoids the BS that a lot of other lending protocols use.  The incentives make supplying compelling because the yield scales with borrowing demand, and it’s single-asset so I don’t deal with impermanent loss.\n* No direct liquidations – This is a massive differentiator. On Aave, Morpho, Compound, etc, if your collateral value drops too much, you get liquidated. This means is you're close to to your max LTV, you're constantly chart watching and nervous.  But with Teller, loans run on 30-day checkpoints, meaning as long as you pay the interest, your position stays open. If you miss the checkpoint, collateral goes into a Dutch auction where users bid on the collateral to reimburse the lenders. It’s way less stressful and lets you ride out volatility without getting wrecked by a random wick.\n\nThe last point is why Teller feels different to me. Aave, Morpho, and Compound are great, but they’re designed around constant price-based liquidations. Teller flips that model with checkpoint-based loans, and in my opinion, it’s a much better fit for more advanced strategies.\n\nTo me, Teller is perfect for a DeFi-first heavy user as it's designed more for long-term lending &amp; borrowing strategies. \n\nA 30-day checkpoint is a really unique way to solve the high LTV problem in defi. Longer term, I think this model is set up well for on-chain credit systems once ZK-identity becomes more standard, as wallets can have credit scores attached to real identities (but obscured through zk-identity) meaning better borrowing terms for credible borrowers.  \n\nDisclaimer: NFA &amp; I wouldn’t recommend someone brand new to DeFi to dive in.

Just saw this coin the day before yesterday and bought at $1.7 I sold at $2.1 and made a 50 dollar profit. Recently, I’ve been thinking of changing strategy. My portfolio is 85-90% Litecoin (already sold my BTC, BNB, ETH, and SOL to buy Litecoin) because I think it’s pretty solid (commodity, fixed supply, fast, MWEB, treasuries, soon ETF, and most important, cheap). I’m of the philosophy of selling the winners to buy the losers because it’s easier for a 10B marketcap coin to double than it is for Bitcoin to do the same in the same timeframe. I think many people agree with this (otherwise, memecoins wouldn’t be so popular) and also that PoW coins with a fixed supply that have stayed in the market for more than a decade are solid investments. Unfortunately, my thesis proved wrong because LTC has underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, I’m not selling it this cheap and have already holded it from $50 to $114 to $50 to $140 to $70 to now. So I’ll just stay invested there. \n\nMy question though, is about the remaining 15% of my porftolio. My best investment was Injective which I bought with $500 (less than 1% of my portfolio) because I liked the logo and it did a 100x from $1 to $53. Following the same train of thought, I bought OSMO (a Cosmos coin) with part of the profits from INJ but it was the WORST investment. It’s breaking all time lows every day. It’s sitting at a 100M marketcap and I fear it will be delisted or the developers may abandon the project and leave it to die. I’m not a fan of selling coins cheap but I already lost faith in the coin because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or even Solana, it’s not of interest to any institution and doesn’t seem to have a floor. I was thinking of selling the OSMO to buy ASTER at $1.7.\n\nAster is pretty high in marketcap so in theory it’s harder to make a profit but a big marketcap can also be a positive because the coin has “proven itself” (psychology) and, most important, it’s backed by CZ. If he’s promoting it so much, it feels like a legit project. I don’t trust Binance with my life but the guy sent BNB from 10 cents to 1K and has built a crypto empire. I think $ASTER is here to stay and could double this year, if not more. And even if the bear market comes, I think it would drop less than OSMO. \n\nWhat do you guys think, should I pull the trigger and buy ASTER? Are you buying at these prices? Or are you out already? Or do you think it’s not a good project and better to just buy gold or have USDT? I need to make a 2X to recover my losses from OSMO.

Ask us anything now and find out how to make the most of Season 0 before we go live on Sept 29.\n\n**What is Makina and why is it relevant to the sub?**  \nMakina is a DeFi Execution Engine that connects professional strategists (Operators) with onchain users through programmable vaults called Machines. The first Operator that will deploy on Makina will be Dialectic, an industry-leading crypto-native fund.Machines are designed for institutional-grade yield strategies that anyone with a wallet can access. Risk management is enforced onchain with pre-approved instructions, parameter caps, atomic unwinds, and a lot of other innovative tech.\n\nThis is relevant to the sub because it tackles issues that matter in DeFi today: yield, transparency, risk management, fair launches, and execution infrastructure.\n\n**What’s happening now?**  \nOn September 29 at 12:00 UTC we launch Season 0.

Contributing further to the confusion, fee logic has actually changed in 2025 which has been largely overlooked due to the more significant changes that most are focused on (e.g. 1099-DA, per wallet cost tracking etc).\n\nAll these changes are discussed in the IRS Final Regulations: [Gross Proceeds and Basis Reporting by Brokers and Determination of Amount Realized and Basis for Digital Asset Transactions](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/09/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for) (what a mouth-full)\n\n***Let's dive in.***\n\nPreviously transaction fees were typically included in the cost basis of the asset you're receiving. In other words, if I swap BTC for ETH and pay a transaction fee for this swap, I include the fair value of the fee into the cost basis of the received ETH. This means the tax benefit of this fee isn't felt until I sell the ETH.\n\n***What's changed?***\n\nIn 2025, the fee now reduces the proceeds side of the transaction. Meaning the tax benefit of the fee is felt when the fee is paid (most of the time, will discuss exceptions shortly). So if you swap 1 BTC for 25 ETH and pay a transaction fee, rather than taking the FV of the fee and adding it to the cost basis of the ETH, you actually take the FV of the fee and reduce the proceeds realized on the 1 BTC disposal, making the the tax benefit realized immediately. Surprisingly, this treatment actually benefits taxpayers which is great!\n\nAdditionally, if a fee is paid in the same asset type being received is considered withheld, the tax lot pulled for the fee disposal is to be pulled from the same pool of assets being received (not your existing pools). So if you pay a 1 ETH withheld transaction fee in the scenario above, it uses 1 of the 25 ETH received as opposed to one of your existing ETH, which results in a $0 gain making the fee calc easy.\n\n***Let's review an example:***\n\nFacts:\n\n* You have 1 BTC with a cost basis of $1,000.\n* You hold 1 ETH in your account with a cost basis of $200\n* You swap the 1 BTC for 25 ETH when BTC is worth $25,000 and ETH is worth $1,000\n* This swap includes a 1 ETH transaction fee (ETH still worth $1,000)\n\n**OLD** gain/loss calc:\n\n* 1 BTC disposal with $24,000 gain ($25,000 proceeds - $1,000 cost basis)\n* 1 ETH disposal with $800 gain ($1,000 proceeds - $200 cost basis)\n* 25 ETH received have a cost basis of $26,000 total ($25,000 from BTC + $1,000 in fee paid)\n\n**NEW** gain/loss calc (2025 and onward):\n\n* 1 BTC disposal with $23,000 gain ($24,000 proceeds - $1,000 cost basis) (**the FV of the fee reduces the proceeds of the BTC disposal**)\n* 1 ETH disposal with no gain (deemed to be withheld from the received ETH)\n* 24 ***net*** ETH received have a cost basis of $24,000 total ($24,000 from BTC), with the old 1 ETH still retaining its initial $200 cost basis\n\nYou can review the specific examples within the Federal Register using this direct link to the examples section: [Fee Examples](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/09/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for#p-440)\n\n***What are the exceptions?***\n\nIf you pay cash for crypto and pay fee in cash, then this will still get added to your cost basis of the received asset. It's as if the cash you paid was simply higher. In other words, if you buy 1 ETH for $2,500, and pay a $200 fee, then the total cash you spent is $2,700 so the cost basis on your ETH is $2,700.\n\nAs we approach tax season, its important to ensure you're aware of the new regs and how they impact your taxes. Hopefully most softwares should be doing this for you, but always worth double checking to ensure they've made the changes (especially since this will generally help taxpayers reduce taxable gains this year).\n\nWishing everyone a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year!\n\n\\- JustinCPA, Product Lead @ Summ (formerly Crypto Tax Calculator)", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pp6egf/serious_tax_on_crypto_transaction_fees_us/", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency"}

Tokenized US Treasury products have surged since early 2024 and are now roughly an ~$9 billion market depending on the tracker you look at. Some datasets frame it as a ~50x move from a very small base, while broader trackers show it was already closer to the ~$1B range in early 2024, so the multiple depends on what’s included. Either way, the direction is the same: big growth in a short time.\n\nBlackRock's BUIDL fund is leading the pack at around ~$1.7B in assets. Its basically short-term US government bonds that you can hold and settle onchain with daily yield. Other big players include Circle's USYC, Superstate's USTB and Ondo Finance's OUSG. All of them offering tokenized access to government debt through regulated structures.\n\nThe reason this matters is because US Treasury bills are perfect for bringing traditional finance onto blockchain. You get the safety of government backing combined with blockchain settlement efficiency. Plus institutions can use these as collateral for other activities which improves capital efficiency.\n\nMajor banks are already testing this stuff. DBS which is Southeast Asia's largest bank has piloted tokenized products and talked about using tokenized assets in institutional workflows like collateral management. This isnt some DeFi experiment anymore, its actual institutional infrastructure being built.\n\nThe timing makes sense too. With interest rates being higher than they've been in years, these products are offering decent yield compared to just holding stablecoins. And institutions get all the benefits of blockchain settlement without taking on crypto market risk.\n\nAnd as more portfolios hold yield-bearing assets on-chain...often across multiple wallets, chains, and structures...the operational side starts to matter too. Tracking yield, redemptions, and tax treatment across these instruments is where tools like Awaken Tax quietly become relevant, especially for funds and active investors managing both crypto-native and tokenized TradFi exposure.\n\nThis is basically tradfi and crypto merging in real time. When you see billions flowing into tokenized treasuries while the broader crypto market is struggling, it shows theres serious institutional demand for blockchain infrastructure even if they're not buying Bitcoin or ETH directly.

Bitcoin's not much better, BTC is down 5% this week, ETH down 9%. The kicker? These are supposed to be the \"mature investors\" bringing stability to crypto.\n\nHere's what's frustrating me about this whole institutional adoption narrative. Traditional finance players are trying to force-fit legacy infrastructure onto blockchain rails. They're dealing with the same back-office nightmares, settlement delays, and fee structures that existed before crypto even existed. Then they wonder why institutional capital is so flighty when markets get choppy.\n\nI've been researching what actual institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure looks like beyond just wrapped ETFs, and there's a massive gap between what exists and what's actually needed. Real institutions need 24/7 markets (not just crypto market hours), atomic settlement (not T+2), and significantly lower costs than what TradFi offers.\n\nBeen following a project called Sphinx Protocol that's trying to tackle this for commodity derivatives specifically (oil, gas, futures, options). They raised $2M pre-seed back in June and are currently in their pre-testnet phase with mainnet supposedly coming later next year. The angle is building a permissioned L1 specifically for energy commodities with institutional compliance baked in from day one, not bolted on after.\n\nWhat caught my eye is they're claiming 10x lower fees and 28% better capital efficiency vs traditional exchanges, plus atomic settlement. Big promises obviously, and ngl I'm skeptical until testnet actually drops, but at least someone's trying to build proper infrastructure instead of just another token wrapper. If blockchain can't dramatically improve the actual trading infrastructure and just becomes another wrapper for the same old system, what's the point? We need better plumbing, not more speculation on broken pipes.\n\nAnyone else watching infrastructure plays in the commodity/derivatives space?

The next near-term milestone is a Senate committee markup in January (per White House crypto czar David Sacks), but Brandt’s saying it’s not gonna be “world-shaking” for BTC.\n\nHis take is pretty straightforward. Yeah the regulation is needed and will be good for the industry overall, but having an asset get regulated isnt some earth-shattering event. Especially when alot of Bitcoin maxis never wanted regulation in the first place. He thinks it’ll clarify the regulatory structure which is positive but wont redefine Bitcoin’s value.\n\nJohn Glover from Ledn agrees and says the Clarity Act has already been priced into the market. Any benefits to price action would be more delayed over time as Bitcoin and ETH gain broader acceptance as investable assets. So dont expect fireworks on day one.\n\nThe more interesting part is Brandt’s price prediction. He believes Bitcoin is currently in a bear market and could trade down to $60,000 in Q3 2026. Thats a 31% drop from current levels around $88,000. He says the charts are suggesting this move but his downside bias is “moderate” because of stuff like the Clarity Act providing some support.\n\nSenator Cynthia Lummis has been pushing hard to advance the bill and mentioned the crypto industry was getting concerned about progress since drafts kept changing during bipartisan discussions. The bill addresses digital asset market structure which is important long-term even if it doesnt create immediate price action.\n\nAnd honestly, if the vibe shifts from “number go up” to “rules + reporting,” that’s where people get caught off guard. Not because regulation instantly pumps price, but because it nudges more activity onto cleaner rails. If you’re actively trading or doing DeFi, it’s also the moment where keeping your cost basis straight matters more than ever, and tools like Awaken tax become less “nice to have” and more “please don’t let me guess my taxes.”\n\nSo basically temper your expectations if you’re expecting the Clarity Act to moon Bitcoin.", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 8, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pr4fh7/peter_brandt_says_clarity_act_wont_move_bitcoins/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Earlier this week the SEC gave DTCC the green light to tokenize Russell 1000 stocks, Treasuries, and ETFs starting H2 2026. Not sure why this isn't bigger news, but this is legitimately the infrastructure moment we've been waiting for.\n\nRight now if an institution wants to trade stocks and crypto together, they're dealing with a mess. T+2 settlement on stocks means you're stuck waiting 2 days, T+0 on crypto means instant, completely different risk systems, and you've got counterparty risk on both sides. It's inefficient as hell.\n\nIn short, in 2026 everything moves on-chain. T+0 settlement. Single margin pool. One ledger.\n\nYeah, this doesn't pump Bitcoin tomorrow. But it does mean the institutional capital sitting on the sidelines waiting for \"real infrastructure\" now has an actual date on the calendar. H2 2026 is when serious volume starts moving on-chain. If you understand why institutions are moving to DeFi, you're going to be ahead of most people in 2026. It's not really about lower fees. It's about actually being able to settle instantly and run your capital efficiently. Once you can cross-margin Russell 1000 stocks against commodities against crypto with instant settlement? That's when institutions actually move real volume.\n\nThe thing nobody's talking about:\n\nThe protocols actually building for this stuff now—institutional settlement infrastructure, real asset trading—are positioning themselves for what's coming. Most DeFi is built for retail traders. For example, Sphinx Protocol (a commodities-on-chain project still in development) is building exactly this kind of infrastructure: T+0 atomic settlement and cross-margining for institutions. There's a quiet wave of projects that started building on this thesis months ago, and now with this SEC news, their timing looks prescient.\n\nKeep an eye on how tokenization develops in H2 2026.

CZ stresses that disciplined strategies like dollar cost averaging (DCA) and risk management are far more effective than chasing short term hype.\n\nThe recent Crazy 48h Event provided a perfect case study of this philosophy. Traders witnessed extreme volatility across multiple phases, Liquidity surged, shorts were liquidated en masse, and Bitcoin briefly spiked before retracing. Now phase 5 is live, those who had accumulated during earlier fearful phases were rewarded, while latecomers who chased the rally found themselves caught in the reversal. It was a textbook example of CZ’s principle in action.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Bitget hosted the event, giving traders worldwide a front row seat to the chaos. The most effective Bitcoin strategy is to stay disciplined and avoid emotional trading. Bitcoin has historically rewarded long term holders, so treating it as a strategic allocation rather than a quick trade is key.\n\nAt the same time, risk management is critical. Keep Bitcoin as a reasonable portion of your portfolio, avoid leverage, and remember that regulation and sentiment shifts can cause sharp swings.

The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nAlso, the second you *do* recover something like this, there’s a whole “ok now what” layer people forget. Cost basis, old exchange records, DeFi trails, what’s taxable vs what’s just a transfer. That part isn’t fun, but it’s real. Stuff like Awaken tax exists basically for that exact cleanup when your history is chaotic and you don’t want to guess and overpay.\n\nIts kinda funny but also dark when you think about how much wealth is permanently locked away because people forgot passwords or lost hardware.

People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world.

The company's fiat reserve of $1.44 billion provides an additional safety cushion.\n\nMiners are certainly under pressure: the estimated cost of mining is $90,000, forcing high-cost players to sell coins at current prices. However, experts consider this factor to be less important than the stability of MSTR's share price. \n\nInterestingly, the success of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin accumulation strategy hinges on JPMorgan. If the bank excludes MSTR shares from the MSCI index in January, the shares will continue to depreciate and the Bitcoin price will plummet too.\n\nNevertheless, JPMorgan analysts remain optimistic, expecting the first cryptocurrency to reach $170,000 within six to twelve months.

This marks the moment when **crypto and blockchain officially enter the balance sheets of Wall Street**, bringing about true mass adoption—not through a bottom-up de-central-bank revolution, but a **top-down financial infrastructure upgrade**.\n\nRetail traders are like the tide; institutions are the sea.  \nThe tide retreats. The sea does not.\n\n# Reviewing 2025: The \"First Year of Institutions\n\n* **Inflow Source:** Almost all major capital flowing into **BTC/ETH** in 2025 came from institutions (67% of allocation), not retail. Retail traders focused on meme/altcoins.\n* **Key Drivers:** The explosion of **ETFs** (holding 5.7%–7.4% of circulating BTC supply) monopolized Bitcoin's primary inflow routes.\n* **Market Formation:** Low tradable supply (due to ETF custody) combined with continuous institutional buying created a **liquidity-shock bull market**.\n* **Institutional Catalyst:** **U.S. regulatory clarity** (stablecoin laws, ETF approvals) enabled legal, compliant, and scaled institutional entry to meet massive demand (estimated 80:1 demand-supply ratio for BTC).\n\n# The Trillion-Dollar Impact\n\n* **Financial Scale:** Institutions control 70–80% of the $600T+ global investable assets. A mere **1% portfolio reallocation** from this pool could **double BTC's market cap** (trillions of dollars).\n* **Core Narrative:** This shift makes **Real World Assets (RWA)** the core narrative of the next cycle.\n\n# Long-Term Roles of Major Assets\n\n* **BTC:** Becomes the **Digital Gold** and an institutional reserve asset, driving slow, trend-driven price movements.\n* **ETH:** Becomes the **\"Equity Asset\"** of the global on-chain economy, valued based on network scale and usage, offering staking yield (dividends).\n\n# Opportunity &amp; Strategy Shift\n\n* **Retail's New Role:** Retail transitions from **narrative makers to price followers**.

Also while there are no technical dependencies between Bitcoin and all those alt coins, there is actually super-strong dependency and everyone can see how precisely all altcoins copy bitcoin (with exception here or there). This is a clear evidence of still speculative component in price, and very little value. If trust in bitcoin shakes, whole industry shakes - a dominantly trust based “asset class” as the real use and value still needs to be developed. \n\nBut what about that cycle, which seems to be broken now? \n\nIMO the cycle was kind of convention created by bitcoin community - and it was passed on newcomers. Since it is all mostly based on trust, this convention was kind of guide in terms of where we are - is it good to buy, enter or sell? It worked somehow. Also part of this cycle were those waves or sequence:\n\n1. Cash BTC\n2. Pump and dump ether\n3. Pump and dump altcoin1-n \n\nAll was like a scripted game which helped to navigate.\n\nBut this “seasonality” does not exist on WallStreet and in Fin industry at all. The speculation there is omnipresent but most assets have underlying value - commodities are best example and events affecting underlying value is what drives price movements adjusted by speculation and trading approaches. \n\nSo once these big institutional players went into bitcoin, many applauded as price went up. However “kids game/convention” was effectively broken as these guys do not follow some convention, cycle etc. They came with their very own rules!  \n\nIMO they did not join this game just to pump and dump massively this asset and “destroy” further adoption potential. \nTheir strategy is more long term and less about that massive volatility. They dont like huge crashes. IMO it is these guys who protected price from “cyclic crash” which they did not join, they bought the dips triggered by retailers etc. \n\nSo the game changed. That is my opinion, but I keep hearing those who still think all is the same and they rule the game - they believe in classic cycle, which is not reality any more IMO. \n\nSo folks, is my reasoning flawed or how do you see that?", "lang": null, "likes": 0, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pbhuqz/crypto_cycle_rationale/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Bitcoin dropped over 5% and was trading around $86,435, while Ethereum slid more than 6% to roughly $2,843. The weakness wasn’t limited to the top two coins. Solana fell more than 7%, and broader altcoins followed the same trend Dogecoin slipped nearly 9%. The pressure extended to Asia as well, after the People’s Bank of China issued a warning about illegal digital currency activity, pulling down several Hong Kong–listed crypto-linked stocks. Market sentiment remains risk-off, and analysts say a large chunk of the move appears tied to liquidations. Ben Emons of Fedwatch Advisors told CNBC that a roughly $400 million exchange liquidation was a major driver of Monday’s downturn. He also pointed to the extremely high leverage still present on crypto exchanges, with some platforms offering up to 200x leverage. According to Emons, the amount of perpetual futures leverage outstanding estimated around $787 billion dwarfs ETF-linked exposure, and leaves the market vulnerable to more forced selling if prices remain weak. Bitcoin’s behavior continues to show stronger correlation with tech indexes, especially the Nasdaq, something that became obvious during October’s market slide. Emons also highlighted that the current environment is heavily driven by retail traders, which typically adds more volatility and faster reactions during sell-offs. Broader macro uncertainty isn’t helping either. Questions around U.S. interest rate cuts, combined with concerns about stretched valuations in the AI sector, added to November’s choppy action and crypto volatility has followed the same pattern. For now, analysts describe the setup as fragile, with sentiment still cautious and leverage remaining a key risk factor if prices fall further.", "lang": null, "likes": 6, "replies": 3, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1pbbmdg/crypto_starts_december_in_the_red_as_bitcoin/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

I asked them exactly who scooped my order and pocketed the hefty premium and the agent broke off the chat.  \n\nYes, I made a mistake. No I did not expect to be completely taken advantage of and ripped off by an opportunistic broker. Is this not outright thievery or am I overreacting? I now trust Robin Hood about as far as I can throw Vlad. I will definitely be taking all my crypto business elsewhere. Please be forewarned when entering limit orders.

Bitcoin is having one of its worst Novembers since the 2018 bear market and here’s why it’s happening.\n\nSo far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.\n\nHistorically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.\n\nSince those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.\n\nAnother huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.\n\nSome analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.\n\nOne interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks", "lang": null, "likes": 43, "replies": 18, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1p9ecgc/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon.

This hybrid rollout allows investors to choose between the traditional fund and the blockchain based version recorded directly on Ethereum.\n\nThe first transaction was successfully executed on November 4, demonstrating that tokenized shares can coexist alongside traditional structures. The move reflects growing interest in leveraging blockchain for liquidity, transparency, and more flexible trading options.\n\nThe rollout was developed with CACEIS, a European asset servicing group, which provided the necessary tokenization infrastructure, investor wallets, and a digital order system to process subscriptions and redemptions. According to the companies, this setup helps streamline operations and widens access to new investor channels.\n\nTokenization also opens the door to 24/7 trading of traditionally static assets. Investors now have the ability to engage with money market funds in ways previously impossible, potentially increasing efficiency and broadening participation in a historically conservative segment. Platforms like bitget have also been experimenting with copy trading via GetAgent, allowing users to mirror strategies and trade tokenized or onchain assets, providing a parallel example of how blockchain tools are bridging traditional and crypto finance. Always DYOR before participating.\n\nOverall, Amundi’s tokenized fund represents a small but significant step toward integrating conventional finance with blockchain innovation.

When Will the Real Trend Be Revealed? Hello everyone! We've recently seen a temporary spike in Bitcoin's price, which has raised hopes for many.

If key support levels fail (80K), the primary downtrend could resume.\n2. **The Role of Extreme Sentiment:** We know that when market sentiment becomes extremely negative and everyone gives up hope, that's often when a major **Bullish Reversal** occurs, and the market starts its journey toward a new All-Time High (ATH). This situation is commonly referred to as **\"Blood in the streets.\"**\n\n# The Current State: Neither Bull Nor Bear?\n\nRight now, I don't see the kind of extreme negative sentiment that would confirm we've hit the final bottom. There is some Fear, but not the widespread Panic or Despair needed for a massive reversal.\n\n* **The Market's Next Move:** After this rally, the price will likely enter a **Sideways Consolidation** phase.\n* **The Deciding Factor:** This consolidation period will be the key to determining whether we get **Bull Continuation** or **Bear Trend Continuation**. We will only be able to confirm whether we're heading toward new highs or sinking further down after observing the market's movement for a few more days/weeks.\n\n  \n**Are you currently seeing \"Extreme Despair\" in the market?** Or is more panic yet to come?

Bitcoin is seeing renewed selling pressure after on-chain data showed over $7.5 billion worth of whale inflows moving into Binance over the last 30 days. These are large BTC deposits from wallets that typically hold long-term and when they start moving coins onto exchanges, it usually means one thing: they want liquidity. What’s catching attention is how closely this looks to March 2025, when a similar wave of whale deposits hit exchanges. Within weeks, BTC dropped from around $102K to $70K as selling pressure picked up. This current inflow trend is almost identical in size and pace. On-chain analysts are pointing out a few red flags: Exchange liquidity is rising, which makes big sell orders easier to execute. Spot trading volume is thinning, so whales have more influence over price swings. Derivative markets are cutting long exposure, showing a shift toward caution. Long-term holder supply is falling, meaning older coins are moving out of storage usually not a bullish sign. The $7.5B figure is now one of the largest 30-day inflows of the year, and if this pace continues, it could point to a broader risk-off setup. But to be fair, this doesn’t guarantee a crash whales also move funds for hedging, collateral, or arbitrage.

That peak-to-trough move of roughly one third has been described by BeinCrypto as the steepest pullback of this bull cycle so far, and you can feel the uncertainty in the way people are trading.\n\nSome on-chain and technical analysts are arguing that, despite how nasty this correction has been, the broader uptrend from the past year and a half is still intact. They’re basically framing this as a classic bull market pullback – ugly in the short term, but still within the kind of drawdowns we saw in previous cycles before new highs.\n\nThe other camp is more cautious. Bitcoin has run straight into resistance in this low-90k area and stalled. If buyers can’t step in soon and turn this into a clean higher low, there’s a real chance we end up retesting the recent lows down in the low-80k region – and a decisive break below 80k is exactly the kind of level some analysts have warned could accelerate selling.\n\nA lot of traders are starting to treat this as a potential range rather than a straight trend. The idea is something like: resistance up around the low-90s, support down near the prior lows, and opportunities only at the extremes – fade euphoria near the top of the range and bid fear near the bottom – until the macro picture or flows force a real breakout.\n\nThe problem is that short term players are going to get wrecked whichever way it eventually breaks. If price squeezes above the current resistance, anyone who’s been shorting every lower high gets steamrolled. If we lose those low-80s supports, all the “buy every dip” crowd gets dragged into a much deeper drawdown than they signed up for.\nEvery squeeze and flush you play now turns into a cluster of taxable disposals later. I have been running my exchanges and wallets through awaken.tax just to see what my year actually looks like if I keep scalping this range instead of being surprised at filing time.\n\nRight now it feels like a waiting game. Macro data and the next Fed decision are hanging over everything, liquidity is thinner than it was near the top, and volatility is sleeping just enough to make people overconfident.

Short- and mid-term indicators show a bearish bias: price is below the EMA10/20/50, MACD is negative, and ADX indicates a weak trend. Oscillators are near oversold (RSI \\~32, stochastic in oversold with an early bullish cross) while price has breached the lower Bollinger Band — a volatility signal that can persist. Immediate support and resistance are tightly spaced (\\~±1–3.7%), with a heavy resistance cluster at 93.6–98k and deeper historical supports well below 42k. This is a tactical environment; momentum and band signals conflict, so resolution may be reflected in weekly closes around the pivot, R1/R3 and S1/S3.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nBitcoin’s weekly price structure frames tactical decisions for traders and for investors tracking trend direction. The latest weekly snapshot (close 86,820, data to 2025-11-24) shows price sitting just under the weekly pivot, inside a volatile, wide-range market. That proximity suggests near-term levels are particularly relevant, as small weekly moves can shift the immediate bias.\n\nThe current picture (quick facts)\n\n* Last weekly close: $86,820.\n* Weekly pivot: 86,895.6 (price is fractionally below).\n* Short/mid MAs: Price &lt; EMA10 (101,354), EMA20 (105,130), EMA50 (99,668).\n* Long MA: SMA200 at 55,798 — well below current price (long-term structural support).\n* ADX: 11.9 — weak trend strength on the weekly timeframe.\n* Market phase labeled: bearish drift with choppy range behavior.\n\nIn plain terms: the mid-term technical structure is biased down (lower highs &amp; lower lows) while the market lacks strong directional momentum.\n\nWhat the indicators are saying\n\n* MACD: Negative and below its signal line (MACD −2,243; signal 1,867; hist −4,109) — momentum is bearish.\n* RSI (14): 32.3 — close to oversold but not an extreme reversal signal on its own.\n* Stochastic: K 13.8, D 10.5 — in oversold territory with K above D (an early bullish cross that can precede short squeezes or temporary bounces).\n* Bollinger Bands: Price is below the lower band (Upper \\~130.7k, Lower \\~90.1k) — a band breach that signals elevated volatility; breaches can persist during trending moves or violent chop.\n* ATR (weekly): \\~10.25k — points to high weekly volatility range.\n\nTakeaway: Oscillators are showing oversold conditions while trend and momentum remain unfavorable. That creates a mixed signal set — short-term bounce candidates within a broader bearish context.\n\nSupport, resistance and the pivot map\n\nKey immediate levels (distance from last close in parentheses):\n\n* Pivot (range mid): 86,895.6 (+0.09%).\n* Resistance cluster (near-term): R1 87,911 (+1.26%), R2 89,002 (+2.51%), R3 90,018 (+3.69%).\n* Extended resistance cluster (supply zone): 93,625 (+7.84%), 94,500 (+8.85%), 96,250 (+10.86%), 98,000 (+12.88%). Major resistance around 108,500 (+24.98%).\n* Near supports: S1 85,804 (−1.17%), S2 84,789 (−2.34%), S3 83,698 (−3.61%).\n* Deep, historical frequency supports (contextually distant): 42,000 (−51.6%), 29,750 (−65.7%), 26,250 (−69.8%), 19,250 (−77.8%).\n\nInterpretation: Price currently trades inside a tight weekly pivot band (\\~±1–3.7%). Overhead supply becomes significant above \\~93.6k and could stall any meaningful recovery. Immediate downside interest clusters around the S1–S3 band.\n\nVolume and recent market context\n\n* Notable volume spikes: 2024-11-11 (breakout volume surge, +100% vs typical) and 2025-03-03 (elevated selling, +35%). Recent selling waves showed expansion in volume, which supports the bearish mid-term narrative.\n* Range (last \\~3 months on the weekly): low \\~86.8k, high \\~123.5k — a wide range (≈42% width relative to the low), reflecting choppy behavior and elevated whipsaw risk.\n\nReading the risk map: what to watch\n\n* Tactical breakout indicators: Weekly closes above 90,018 (R3) would degrade the immediate downside bias and clear a pivot stack, opening the path toward the 93.6–98k supply zone.\n* Breakdown indicators: Weekly close below 83,698 (S3) would confirm a near-term structural break and increase the chance of deeper retests inside the broader range.\n* Narrow triggers: Because the pivot and S1/R1 sit within \\~1–2% of price, small weekly moves matter for near-term positioning.\n\nNote: These are technical trigger observations — not trade recommendations.\n\nConflicting signals and how to interpret them\n\nThere is a multi-horizon conflict: the SMA200 sits far below current price (a long-term structural support), while short- and mid-term EMAs and MACD are bearish. The resolution honors the current structure and multi-horizon evidence: lower highs/lows and weak ADX favor a mid-term bearish view, while the SMA200 provides a longer-term backdrop that would matter only if price moved materially lower.\n\nAlso, oversold oscillators (RSI/Stoch/CCI) and a Bollinger lower-band breach can lead to counter-trend bounces; however, oversold readings can persist in weak trends — so bounces would be described as tactical unless accompanied by structural breaks such as weekly closes above R3 or sustained moving-average crossovers.\n\nBottom line — clear takeaway\n\nBitcoin sits marginally below the weekly pivot at \\~86.9k in a weak, choppy downtrend. Momentum remains negative, but oscillators are oversold and price has breached the lower Bollinger Band — a setup that can produce short-term rebounds inside a larger bearish context. The near-term focus centers on weekly closes around 90,018 (neutralizes the immediate downside stack) and 83,698 (escalates downside risk) for a clearer directional read. Expect volatility to remain elevated given band breaches and widened ATR, with moves that can be swift and noisy.\n\nThis is a technical snapshot intended to clarify structure and levels, not a forecast or financial advice.", "lang": null, "likes": 1, "replies": 1, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1p5hw2j/weekly_bitcoin_oversold_snapshot_testing_the_869k/", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets"}

DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is the proven, low-stress method to beat volatility and build wealth long-term.\n\nThe Problem: Why Trading Fails (Especially Now):  \n  \nAs crypto enthusiasts, we all dream of buying the absolute bottom and selling the absolute top. But let's be realistic:\n\nEmotional Decisions: When Bitcoin drops 10% in an hour, panic sets in, and you sell at a loss. When it jumps 15%, you FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) in at the top.

Onchain data suggests that some larger investors are offloading positions, locking in losses similar to what we saw during past crash cycles. This is not unusual, historically, sharp declines often trigger capitulation among those who bought near the highs. It’s a reminder that even smart money can get shaken out when sentiment turns fragile, and that price action alone does not always reflect long term fundamentals.\n\nFor retail traders, this environment is tricky. Avoiding losses is not about predicting the exact bottom, its about managing risk in a disciplined way. That means setting stop losses, not over leveraging, and being comfortable with smaller position sizes until volatility cools down. It also means resisting the urge to chase pumps or panic sell during dips. Protecting capital should be your first priority, because opportunities will always come back once the market stabilizes. Many experienced traders emphasize patience, scaling into positions gradually, and keeping cash reserves ready for when conviction is stronger.\n\nInterestingly, some traders are diversifying their approach instead of focusing solely on BTC. With Black Friday events ongoing, a few are experimenting with structured strategies like spot grids and reward based campaigns, where returns can be boosted, some even mention 100% back offers. I have heard these events are live on certain CEXes, including Bitget and others. Whether or not you participate, it shows how traders are looking beyond just holding BTC, exploring side opportunities while waiting for clearer market direction.

Has bitcoin lost a lot of its real world utility with the rising popularity of stablecoins? I'm new to bitcoin and crypto in general, fyi.\n\nMy impression of bitcoin is it has two use cases. The first is as an investment vehicle. Bitcoin has no tangible value, so any appreciation is based on utility and perceived value/scarcity. Utility is tied to its second use case- a way to hold and transfer wealth that is very difficult for the government to monitor and seize. It allows people and organizations to secretly do business and to smuggle/hide wealth from authorities.\n\nWith the advent of stablecoins, either tied to fiat currency or assets like gold, doesn't this have the potential to replace bitcoin's utility with cryptocurrencies that are much more stable in value?

He did not clearly say this was his entire BTC stack, just that he sold this amount.\n\nWhats interesting is hes not selling because he thinks Bitcoins done. He says hes reinvesting the proceeds into two surgery centers and a billboard business that he estimates will generate about 27500 dollars in tax free monthly income by February 2026.\n\nHe also said hes still very bullish and optimistic on Bitcoin and plans to start buying again using the cash flow from those businesses. Earlier this month he repeated his view that BTC could hit around 250k by 2026.\n\nThe timing is what caught people off guard tho.

We are now down a bit over 30 percent from the October all time high around 126k.\n\nThe Fear and Greed Index hit 11 on Friday which is extreme fear territory and one of the lowest readings this year. Some people are genuinely worried we are sliding into a deeper bear phase.\n\nBut some analysts including Bitfinex commentators have framed the ETF outflows and this downturn as short term stress in positioning and macro, not necessarily a full breakdown of long term institutional interest. And veteran trader Peter Brandt still thinks Bitcoin reaches 200k in the next cycle, roughly around Q3 2029.\n\nSo Kiyosakis move seems more tactical than anything.

Lately I’ve been spending more time on Rainbow, and yeah, the ETH-only thing keeps getting in my way. I actually like how clean and smooth the app feels, but the moment I need to do anything on Bitcoin or Solana, it turns into a hassle. Suddenly I’m opening two or three other wallets just to move stuff around or check balances, which kind of defeats the point of having a “main” wallet.\n\nI get why Rainbow does it. Focusing on Ethereum makes the UX way better and less cluttered, and if you’re deep into DeFi or NFTs on ETH, it’s honestly great. But if you touch other chains even a little, it starts to feel limiting. Simple things like moving funds or tracking everything in one place become more annoying than they should be.\n\nRight now I’m stuck in this half-and-half setup. Rainbow for ETH, then another wallet for Solana, another for Bitcoin. It works, but it feels messy and easy to lose track of stuff. I’ve been seriously thinking about switching to a multi-chain wallet and just keeping ETH there too, even if the UX isn’t as nice.\n\nAt the same time, part of me likes having a dedicated ETH wallet that just does one thing really well.

A recent Bankless tweet discussed the recent increase in companies that are accumulating ETH as part of their treasury. Vitalik Buterin shared his view of the situation: he supports the idea of ETH treasuries, however he is not blindly bullish on it. According to Vitalik having companies hold ETH as part of their treasury allows more users to gain access to it, without having to use a wallet, exchange or DeFi protocol. As a result this will create more economic alignment across the ecosystem and also a path to wider adoption. And of course the more options are available for holding ETH, the stronger the network will be.\n\nAt the same time Vitalik shared an important note: it is not ETH treasuries themselves that are a threat, it is the leverage potential. Vitalik warned that if ETH treasuries transition to leveraging things could turn bad very quickly. In situations where companies begin borrowing against their ETH holdings and the price drops, the pressure to liquidate positions could lead to a cascade of forced liquidations. We witnessed scenarios like this play out time and time again and they never end well.\n\nWe should not ignore this possibility. For reference publicly traded companies like BitMine were reported to hold almost 4 million ETH which represents 3% of the total ETH supply. This level of influence and risk becomes too real once debt is added into the equation, so the conclusion is pretty easy to draw. Having more access to ETH is a good thing but turning ETH into a house of cards is not. An increase in long-term holders will make Ethereum less fragile.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/Bankless/status/2004587304636359056*", "lang": null, "likes": 26, "replies": 28, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pyj2su/vitalik_supports_eth_treasuries_but_warns_about/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

The hype comes later.\n\nPsychology resets every bear market\n\nCapitulation then disbelief then boredom then re-risking\n\nSame emotions, different year.\n\nEthereum doesn’t escape this just because it’s useful but it can somewhat become less shaky in a bear market over time.\n\nETH isn’t trying to be the fastest horse anymore.\n\nIt’s becoming the track. It’s becoming a solid foundation for many projects and useful features. \n\nThat changes how it moves: Less reflexive hype, more delayed repricing, more dependency on ecosystem demand. \n\nHistorically, ETH tends to underperform early cycle and strengthen once capital rotates from “beta” to “quality” and further catch up when utility starts to matter again\n\nIf that pattern holds, ETH isn’t early, it’s loading,\n\nAnd right now whales are busy loading up their bags. \n\nMeanwhile some People Keep Making the mistake that they expect linear appreciation in a cyclical system.\n\n“ETH is stronger than ever… why isn’t price higher?”\n\nMarkets don’t price strength.\n\nThey price marginal demand.\n\nAnd marginal demand shows up late.\n\nBut when we buy the dip we setup ETH for further strength, but keep in mind that markets sometimes swings hard and if you have buy orders ready that can pay off very well. \n\nBut all in all… Ethereum doesn’t need a new cycle theory.\n\nIt needs time for capital to catch up to reality.\n\nThe 4-year cycle isn’t only about Bitcoin halving and mining competition.\n\nIt’s also about when humans collectively decide risk is acceptable again.\n\nThat hasn’t changed and neither has Ethereum’s long-term trajectory. “Too the moon!” Well… I’m not going to the moon but I’m happy with the profits that ETH will bring me. \n\nHit the comment section with where you think we are right now:\n\nLate disbelief? Early re-risking?

That means almost two thirds of the money locked in DeFi is still on Ethereum and the trend is important here. This share grew again during 2024-2025. Back in 2022, Ethereum's dominance dropped to around 45% and a lot of people thought that was the beginning of the end.\n\nSince then, Ethereum has slowly but steadily recovered its position. If you also count Ethereum Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, etc, Ethereum's real share of DeFi goes above 70%. Pretty clear that most DeFi activity still lives inside the Ethereum ecosystem even if it is not always on mainnet.\n\nThis tell us a few things, money is not leaving Ethereum, big capital still prefers Ethereum because it is secure, liquid and prove. Furthermore, more institutions keep choosing Ethereum again and again and this is serious because they hate losing money. Also Layer 2s are not replacing Ethereum, they are strengthening it by making it cheaper and more scalable.\n\nIn other words Ethereum keeps evolving and its the ecosystem everyone its choosing to work with.  \n\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2004659275159708094](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2004659275159708094)", "lang": null, "likes": 20, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pwrl14/2025_review_ethereum_still_dominates_defi_with_64/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

From a structural perspective, a move below recent local lows would not be unusual. ETH has historically shown a tendency to trade through visible support levels and trendlines in order to clear resting liquidity before any sustained continuation. These types of moves are often misread as breakdowns when, in reality, they can simply be part of the market’s process.\n\n  \nWhat stands out more than direction at the moment is compression. Volatility has remained relatively muted for an extended period, and when ETH enters this kind of environment, expansion typically follows. Whether that expansion begins with a downside sweep or a reclaim of current levels is still uncertain, which is why I’m avoiding strong directional bias for now and letting structure guide expectations rather than predictions.\n\n  \nIn the meantime, I’ve been focusing on staying engaged with onchain activity without forcing trades. Personally, that has meant participating in routine Onchain execution while the market continues to develop. As part of that process, I’ve taken part in Bitget current Onchain challenge, not as a trading signal or recommendation, but simply as a structured way to remain active during a slower, more indecisive market phase.\n\n  \nOne observation from that experience is that BGB functions primarily as a utility token tied to platform usage rather than short-term narrative trading. Gaining exposure through participation and activity feels fundamentally different from speculative positioning, especially for those thinking in longer time horizons.  \nFor now, ETH remains a market where patience, liquidity awareness, and structural context matter more than conviction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1shbp8ufm9g1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd030f4b77b8d9063a6a9d50e130d637f588e65d", "lang": null, "likes": 10, "replies": 4, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pwgf0h/eth_market_structure_and_liquidity_considerations/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

These events also indicate that Ethereum has grown up.\n\nAt the start of the year many people believed that Ethereum was being left behind by Solana and that the Ethereum community was running out of patience. However that changed when the Ethereum Foundation shifted into what Obol calls 'wartime mode.' The new leadership, a different set of priorities and a great deal of effort toward scaling and improving the overall Ethereum user experience suggests that Ethereum was very much awake the whole time.\n\nEthereum made significant upgrades since it went 'wartime mode':\n\n* Pectra made staking more efficient.\n* Institutions stacked ETH and made it a yield-bearing asset.\n* Stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets kept choosing Ethereum, even as new L1's tried to compete.\n* L2's scaled activity without breaking the base layer, proving that a lot of FUD was wrong.\n* Then there is reliability. 10 years, 0 downtime.\n\nAll of this is way more valuable than hype will ever be.

The only thing investors can reasonably do is draw on historical data and past market cycles, while assessing forward-looking fundamentals such as tokenisation, stablecoins, and broader blockchain adoption.\n\nHistorically, Ethereum’s price has been heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors, including wars, political instability, pandemics such as COVID-19, tariffs, and periods of heightened uncertainty. Another significant driver is retail participation and media attention. In 2025, a large share of retail and media focus shifted toward AI, which likely diverted capital away from crypto and into AI-related equities and narratives.\n\nLooking at the data, certain years stand out as particularly weak for Ethereum, notably 2018, 2022, and, so far, 2025. This raises the question of whether Ethereum could extend this pattern of underperformance into 2026. \n\nWhile my personal opinion is ultimately irrelevant, I remain cautiously optimistic that the early months of the year, particularly January and February, could see more constructive price action because of the following reason. There are several potential catalysts that could support the crypto market, including progress on U.S. crypto market structure legislation in January, the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts as inflation eases and new FED chairman. Also, at the beginning of the year, retail usually invests when there is liquidity.\n\nAny thoughts?", "lang": null, "likes": 16, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pvbdk2/eth_monthly_return_performance/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Bridging could easily cost $20 or more, that limited average users and turned simple on-chain actions into expensive decisions. If you were not there it is hard to explain how bad it was. This is why Fusaka is huge, it changed how gas works on mainnet. The network optimized block gas limits and transaction caps so now it can process more activity without fees exploding. Now transactions that used to hurt feel normal xD.\n\nThe way that Sam reacted in his tweet shows the big change in Ethereum user experience. You do not need to plan your day around gas anymore, you do not need to wait for low-traffic hours, you just use the network... whenever.\n\nData after the upgrade shows the rollout went smoothly, we had no downtime and just a few minor early bugs. This is how trust is built and trust brings users back. Lower fees are a nice upgrade and they are the difference between Ethereum being a tool designed for technical users and a network normal people can actually use.

No profit, a lot of uncertainty, easy exit.. but that is not what is happening.\n\nIn the tweet CW points out that inflows to accumulation addresses have actually increased. These wallets are not moving ETH, they are stacking. That means something because whales tend to act early. Whales do not buy aggressively if they expect a long bear market. Right now this current scenario gives whales room to keep buying without chasing pumps.\n\nThis does not guarantee an immediate pump however it does give us some bullish sentiment. When whales buy at breakeven instead of selling they are getting ready for higher prices in the future. If price holds well then this accumulation phase looks like quiet confidence.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/CW8900/status/2002416391274766419*", "lang": null, "likes": 102, "replies": 61, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1psxooh/eth_whales_are_buying_at_breakeven_that_says_a/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

In a recent tweet posted by Garrett ('GarrettBullish') recently, he suggested that ETH could be on the verge of a huge turning point in its comparative performance against the Nasdaq 100. The focus of his tweet is on the ETH/Nasdaq ratio which is the ratio of how ETH has performed against tech stocks vs the dollar.\n\nThis indicator has been tested several times since 2021 and each time it reached the low of around 0.11, ETH had been oversold with its RSI being near 30. And after that.. ETH bounced back. Yesterday ETH closed at $2,827 and the Nasdaq 100 was around 25,147, which put the ratio right back at 0.112 near where it reached in the past before other reversals happened.\n\nIn Garrett's opinion ETH and the Nasdaq are closely related and therefore, there is not much of a gap between the two for long-term. When one falls behind and then catches up to the other, that should happen again and again. The ratio going back to 0.16-0.22 would mean ETH would outperform stocks by a lot when compared to the Nasdaq.\n\nThere is a political side to this as well. The SEC Chairman Paul Atkins showed publicly his approval of tokenization and on-chain settlement of all stocks. Therefore if equities in the U.S. gradually transition to being settled on Ethereum then it means there will be a lot of demand for it.\n\nFor those of you who hold ETH, we can conclude that historical data shows that having patience is the best strategy.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/GarrettBullish/status/2001892822459572520*", "lang": null, "likes": 43, "replies": 26, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pred3f/eth_vs_nasdaq_and_why_eth_looks_ready_to_catch_up/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

As you can see in the chart above, EUR M2 is around $15.5 Trillion and the total Euro stablecoin supply just crossed $1 Billion.\n\nIf we do some math, thats roughly a 0.006% of the underlying money stock. That is not early, that is basically not even on the chart. This tell us a few important things that tend to get lost in Crypto Twitter hype cycles.\n\nEuro stablecoins are still macro irrelevant, even after recent growth, they are effectively invisible compared to the size of the euro monetary system. Furthermore, adoption is massively behind USD stablecoins. Dollars found product market fit on chain years ago. Trading pairs, DeFi collateral, remittances, RWAs, treasuries, etc. Euro rails, still searching for their use case.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is doing the heavy lifting. Most euro stablecoin liquidity and activity lives on Ethereum today. Other chain exist but liquidity is fragmented, thin and often ecosystem \"isolated\".\n\nThis leads to the real issue, there is no dominant euro stablecoin rail. No clear winner.\n\nThis is not a tech problem, it is a regulatory, cultural and institutional problem. European finance moves slower, prioritizes compliance first and lacks the same dollar centric global demand loop. But this will change for sure in the future and if tokenized assets, on chain funds and European RWAs scale in the next years, euro stablecoins wont stay at 0.006% forever and they will become relevant. Ethereum is poised to handle most of it for sure.\n\nEUR stablecoins are still in pre-infrastructure era.\n\nWhen do you think this adoption will happen?\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001838903796404522](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001838903796404522)", "lang": null, "likes": 8, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pr9rwd/eur_stablecoins_are_still_just_0006_of_eur_m2_and/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

(Speculation on the Dec 19 Catalyst) (Disclaimer: I’m not a financial professional or a lawyer. I utilized AI tools to assist in parsing the dense regulatory framework and market plumbing. Treat this as speculation/theory based on my interpretation of public data. I am long BMNR.)\n\n1. The Data Doesn't Add Up (The 0.71 Signal)\nSkeptics keep telling me BMNR is just a \"meme stock\" and the short interest is manageable (~7%). But I’ve been staring at the tape and the math simply isn't adding up.\n• The Vault: BMNR locks up ~3.9 million ETH (3.2% of global supply).  \n• The Tape: FINRA reports ~27M shares sold short.\n• The Anomaly: The \"Days to Cover\" ratio is 0.71.\nWhy this is weird:\nA 0.71 ratio means the entire short position turns over in less than one trading session.\n• The Standard View: \"It's just high liquidity.\"\n• My Hypothesis: For a holding company that acts as a vault, this turnover is incredibly high. It raises the question: Is this volume real, or is it algorithmic churn masking a lack of genuine shares?\n\n2. The \"Shadow Float\" Theory (The Mechanism)\nThis is where it gets interesting. I’ve been digging into how \"locates\" (the requirement to find shares before shorting) work, specifically regarding tokenized assets and DeFi rails alongside the recent SEC \"Sandbox\" news.\n\nThe Loophole Theory:\nWe know that under Reg SHO Rule 203(b)(1), a broker needs \"Reasonable Grounds\" to locate a share.\n\n***IF funds are using \"wrapped\" or tokenized versions of the stock to satisfy these locate requirements...\n***AND if those tokens are being re-hypothecated (lent out multiple times) in DeFi liquidity pools...\n***THEN one physical share could theoretically generate multiple \"valid\" locates.\n\nThe \"Napkin Math\" on the Dark Float:\nIf this mechanism is active, the reported Short Interest is meaningless because the fails wouldn't show up on standard reports—they'd likely end up in the NSCC Obligation Warehouse (ex-clearing).\n- If we assume a standard DeFi leverage multiplier (3x) on the reported short interest...\n- Estimated Shadow Liability: ~81 Million Shares.\nAgain, I do not have access to the internal ledgers to prove this, but this \"Shadow Float\" theory is the only thing that explains the 0.71 turnover ratio to me.\n\n3. The Catalyst: The \"Tokyo Pivot\" (Tomorrow)\nRegardless of how the positions are structured, the funding for these positions is about to get expensive. A huge chunk of global risk-taking is funded by the Yen Carry Trade (borrowing cheap Yen to buy/short US assets).\n• Consensus: The Bank of Japan is projected to hike rates to 0.75% tomorrow (Dec 19).  \n• The Risk: If the Yen strengthens, the cost of maintaining leveraged arbitrage positions spikes.\n\nIf my theory about the \"Shadow Float\" is correct, a rate hike isn't just a macro event…it could act as a margin call on the cheap money that sustains this liquidity.\n\nI’m not guaranteeing a squeeze. However, the options flow today (0.50 Put/Call ratio) suggests that Smart Money is bracing for a move.\nIf the BOJ turns off the \"free money\" tap tomorrow, and if that \"Shadow Float\" exists, the liquidity mirage could evaporate very quickly.\n\nSummary: The official data might not tell the whole story. Watch the BOJ decision tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR: I’ve been analyzing the settlement flows for BMNR and I believe there are structural risks that the market is overlooking.

This might not sound sexy comparing to Solana TPS charts but context matters. Ethereum spent years with basically flat L1 throughput. Now stagnation is over.\n\nWhat changed? You will ask. Well, this is not another \"just use L2s\" narrative (although L2s are still crucial). Scaling is now happening on the settlement layer itself. That is the layer that actually carries Ethereum's economic weight. Finality, security and value settlement.\n\nMore L1 capacity is equivalent to cheaper and more available blockspace for high value activity like DeFi liquidations, large trades, institutional flows, etc.\n\nL2s are amazing at scaling execution but they depend on a strong L1. When L1 throughput increases, the entire rollup ecosystem benefits. Fees stabilize, congestion eases and Ethereum's role as the coordination and settlement hub gets stronger.\n\nIt is very important to have this always in mind:\n\n* L2s scale how much can be done\n* L1 scaling strengthens why Ethereum is the place to do it\n\nExecution can fragment but settlement can't.\n\nEthereum is not trying to win a TPS arms race. It is optimizing for economic gravity and base layer scaling is a massive part of that story.  \n\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001249793180307579](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/2001249793180307579)", "lang": null, "likes": 29, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ppkhs5/ethereum_l1_is_scaling_again_and_this_time_it/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

But there are still two client level optimizations that need to land first, so this isn’t a “done deal” yet.\n\nAlso small correction on the timeline: 2025 had three gas limit bumps. early Feb went 30M to 35M, July went to 45M, late Nov went to 60M.

Helped my friend purchase a home using Ethereum!\n\n1.      They did not want to convert Ethereum to Cash for the purchase to avoid the additional taxes from trading, that felt like a waste of money right off the bat, so it was important to purchase using the Ethereum directly.\n\n2.      We transferred the Ethereum to an escrow service instead of directly to the seller of the house to ensure security of the funds until all terms of the sale were completed. Yes, it took a while to find an escrow service that accepts cryptocurrency in general. Escrow service was also used due to cryptocurrency price volatility, with a clause we agreed upon with the seller that we’ll work together on large price changes. Our agreement was, a decrease of 10% or greater we would value the cryptocurrency at 5% less than the current value we had written in the contract. Similarly for an increase of 10% or greater, we would value the cryptocurrency at 5% more than the value we agreed upon in the contract. Also, the escrow service fees and transaction fees were split 50% between the buyer and seller.\n\n3.      We also had to find a seller that will accept Ethereum which limited our options, but WE DID IT! So some sites like Zillow allow listing your home for sale for cryptocurrency, but whether they did or not, we asked all the sellers of the homes if they would consider a sale in cryptocurrency.\n\n4.      No, we did not use NFTs, just Ethereum. We were talking about creating a NFT for the sale for years, but it just didn’t feel worth the time when it came time to move forward with buying the home. It would’ve just been a cool keepsake for my friend, but not a real digital asset of a title or anything haha. We are still talking about how NFT titles would be awesome if it was more accessible and streamlined in the future.\n\n5.      No, they did not need a loan, so that simplified this process since we didn’t have to wait for confirmation from the mortgage lender etc, it was just between us and the seller and escrow service.\n\nIt was scary seeing so much Ethereum being moved in person. I only see posts about large amounts being moved, but we got sweaty seeing it in real life. Yes, we definitely did a test transaction and quadruple checked the wallet addresses!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask, will try my best to answer all the questions!\n\nEdit 1: lots of comments asking about Capital Gains tax.

The more we see what happens when projects launch, it becomes more clear that the future of crypto belongs to Ethereum L2's.

The majority were not being used frequently enough, also they did not have much revenue. None of them would have been able to afford to keep their validators online had they not minted more and more coins.\n\nNow we see that even the 'best' alt L1's are failing miserably. Solana is another example of this problem. Solana has to continue increasing its hardware requirements to keep its speed.

Over recent months, **ETH’s realised volatility** has remained in the **55–60% annualised range**, compared with **35–40% for Bitcoin**, around **15% for the Nasdaq**, and roughly **10% for the S&amp;P 500**. This gap is not cyclical noise. It reflects Ethereum’s structural position as an asset that concentrates uncertainty rather than diluting it.\n\nImplied volatility reinforces this view. **ETH-DVOL (30-day)** has consistently traded between **65% and 80%**, remaining above realised volatility. The market continues to pay a premium for future uncertainty. Risk is not dismissed; it is explicitly priced.\n\nUnlike equity markets, where volatility is often anticipated without being fully experienced, Ethereum internalises risk. There is no external insurer, no stabilising narrative. ETH does not attempt to appear safe. It forces participants to confront trade-offs directly: between decentralisation and scalability, security and efficiency, monetary restraint and usability.\n\nAs Vitalik Buterin succinctly observed:\n\n&gt;\n\nThose trade-offs are clearly visible in the fundamentals. Approximately **30 million ETH** are currently staked, representing close to **25% of total supply**. This reduces liquid float while amplifying sensitivity to flows and sentiment. Since the introduction of **EIP-1559**, fee burn has periodically exceeded gross issuance, producing episodes of net supply contraction — but without delivering stability. Supply is constrained, not predictable.\n\nAt the same time, **Layer-2 networks** now process multiple times the transaction volume of Layer-1. This improves scalability and lowers costs, yet introduces a new layer of uncertainty around value capture and long-term fee dynamics. Ethereum increasingly resembles an economic system in motion rather than a finished product.\n\nThis combination explains why ETH remains structurally volatile even in calm market conditions. Volatility here is not a sign of dysfunction. It is the price of exposure to an evolving system.\n\nThis past week showed no signs of panic.  \nNor did it signal a return to comfort.\n\nEthereum continues to trade precisely where **potential return begins at the point comfort ends**.", "lang": null, "likes": 45, "replies": 36, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pm7wdm/ethereum_is_not_a_comfortable_asset_the_numbers/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

ETH spent most of this year at a lower price than normal, we can confirm this by looking at monthly data. According to a tweet by Milk Road, ETH logged 8 red months so far this year. In the entire history of ETH only 1 year ended with more red months than that. This is something very important, let's understand why.\n\nWhen an asset dips month after month the selling usually stops being about sentiment, normally it is funds reducing exposure. In other words people who need cash and cannot afford the risk anymore. What happens then is forced selling takes over. According to Milk Road, a lot of that pressure happened in November. Volume went up but price stopped falling at the same pace, usually that is what exhaustion looks like, so sellers are still here but they are running out of bags to sell.\n\nETH is trading in a different environment now, a lot of the investors who needed to sell already did. Treasuries accumulated ETH, weak hands are gone and over-leveraged degens are also gone. Therefore all that is left is a market with fewer people forced to hit the sell button. This does not mean that price goes up tomorrow but it does change things. Since most forced sellers are gone it takes less new demand to pump the price and when sentiment finally changes, there is less resistance on the way up. The bottom may finally be in.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/MilkRoad/status/1999509638493217022*", "lang": null, "likes": 84, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pliqib/eth_has_fewer_forced_sellers_left_after_months_of/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

I stopped trading options to track this \"Liquidity Mirage\" instead. (Target: $6k) I’ve never posted here or anywhere on Reddit really, usually just lurking, but I wanted to share this because the broader market narrative seems completely disconnected from the actual data I'm seeing. I’m a freelance analyst, but I didn't start digging into this for work. I did it because I was frustrated.\n\nBack in October, I was trading near-expiration options on BMNR. It was a daily grind, I was glued to the charts, watching every tick, trying to play the technicals. I wasn't blowing up my account, but I wasn't exactly crushing it either. The ROI on my time was terrible because nothing was respecting the usual setups. The moves didn't match the signals. It felt like the game had changed and nobody sent out the patch notes.\n\nSo I took a step back. I stopped the active trading and started just... counting. For the last month, I’ve been tracking the BMNR ETH Treasury strategy and the broader Ethereum liquidity flows for about 6 hours a day. \n\nThat’s when I saw it. The macro and micro picture has created this weird \"Goldilocks\" scenario that most short-term traders (like my former self) are completely missing because they're looking at lines on a chart instead of the plumbing. \n\nHere is what I found:\n\n1. The \"Bathtub\" Effect (Where did the coins go?) The first thing that stood out was the volume capacity. I track \"Liquid Supply\"—basically coins that are actually sitting on exchanges ready to be bought or sold, not stuck in deep cold storage.\n*** Back in August: ~20.5 Million ETH ***\n*** Right Now: ~16.4 Million ETH ***\n(ETH Exchange Reserve Data via CryptoQuant)\n\nThat is roughly 4.1 million ETH (20% of the float) that just isn't there anymore. It didn't vanish, it just moved to places where it doesn't move:\n\n*** Staking: Fed cuts rates -&gt; Defi yields look way better -&gt; People lock their coins.\n*** The ETF \"Hotel California\": Retail buys the ETF ticker, but the actual ETH gets sent to Coinbase or Fidelity cold storage. It leaves the float.\n*** The Macro Shift: We went from the Fed pulling money out in August (QT) to the Fed pouring money in now (QE + Rate Cuts).\n\n2. The \"Disbelief\" Signal\nThis is the part that convinced me we're early.\nThe CFTC Pilot is a bigger deal than people realize. Institutions can NOW pledge ETH as margin. This is huge! Instead of selling ETH to raise cash, they lock it up to trade other stuff. It basically turns ETH into a high-quality collateral asset. \n\nBut look at the funding rates…In August, funding was positive (everyone was long and leveraged to the gills). Right now? Funding is negative.\nShorts are paying longs to hold positions. This is a classic \"disbelief\" rally. The market expects a crash, so they are fading the move. If we break $3,200, those shorts are forced buyers in a market with 20% less supply.\n\n3. The Retail Distraction\nHonestly, I think the reason this hasn't ripped yet is because everyone is distracted by SOL and XRP. Retail is chasing \"utility\" and payment narratives, which is fine, but they are missing the institutional squeeze happening on ETH. Retail is looking left, institutions are taking the supply from the right. \n\nThe Math (The \"Liquidity Mirage\"):\nI ran some models using the Square Root Law of Market Impact (sounds nerdy, but it just measures how much price moves for every dollar of inflow). Because the order books are so much thinner now, money hits way harder. In July/August, $1B of inflows moved the cap about $20B. Now? That same $1B moves the cap ~$30B. The liquidity on the screen is a mirage. It looks normal, but the depth isn't there.\n\nMy Take:\nBased on the liquidity-adjusted multiplier, I'm looking at $6,000 by mid-Jan as a conservative target. If we get a supply shock event, $7,500+ isn't out of the question. The only way this breaks is if the regulatory stuff around the CFTC pilot gets killed, which would send us back to $3,500.\n\nAnyway, stop trading the ghosts of August. The mechanics are different now.\n(Obviously not financial advice, just sharing what I've been staring at for a month.)\n\nTL;DR: I quit trading chopped-up options last month because the charts weren't making sense. I spent the last 30 days tracking liquidity flows, macro/micro events, news, and used Gemini Ultra to help me understand my observations. The data is clear: 20% of the supply has vanished since August, and new collateral rules just lit a fuse.

Airflow equals transaction flow, compression equals rollups, combustion equals execution, and exhaust equals finality. Read the thermal, pressure and vibration signatures — fees, MEV, liquidity, block cadence — and you can assess the aircraft’s true operating envelope. The present state: high efficiency, stable thrust, with mild thermal hotspots around the mempool.\n\n⸻\n\n1. Air Intake — Transaction Flow &amp; the Mempool\n\nIn aviation, the quality of the intake dictates the quality of the entire cycle.\nOn Ethereum, this is the live stream of transactions and the loading of the mempool.\n\nKey readings on the pilot’s dashboard:\n\t•\tL1 + L2 aggregate throughput: typically 45–60 TPS in steady cruise.\n\t•\tMempool congestion: generally moderate, but sharp spikes during airdrop frenzies and bridge surges.\n\t•\tMEV bundles: the network’s equivalent of warm-air eddies that induce micro-turbulence across block builders.\n\nWhen these inputs remain balanced, airflow is smooth. When the mempool floods, the engine “ingests” more air than ideal, raising operational temperatures — fees escalate accordingly.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Compression Stage — Rollups as the High-Pressure Compressor\n\nA modern turbofan’s compressor raises air density before combustion.\nRollups do precisely that for Ethereum:\n\t•\tThey compress thousands of user actions.\n\t•\tThey forward only the proof to Layer 1.\n\t•\tThey materially improve specific thrust — the effective TPS per unit of gas.\n\nThe result is a cleaner, denser, more disciplined airflow entering the core.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Combustion Chamber — Execution &amp; State Transitions\n\nThis is where thrust is born.\nExecution clients translate compressed input into validated state changes — akin to atomising fuel and igniting it with mathematical certainty.\n\t•\tGas utilisation is your fuel flow.\n\t•\tExecution latency mirrors flame stability.\n\t•\tReorg risk is the analogue of combustion instability — rare, but monitored with the same seriousness as a pilot watching for a flameout oscillation.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Exhaust &amp; Finality — The Engine’s Signature\n\nThe exhaust stream defines the engine’s net thrust.\nFor Ethereum, this is finality: the moment blocks become effectively unchangeable and the aircraft commits to its trajectory.\n\nCurrent state:\n\t•\tSlot finality remains strong and predictable.\n\t•\tEconomic security (staked ETH) acts as the engine’s titanium shell.\n\t•\tBlock times are steady, showing a healthy and well-trimmed powerplant.\n\n⸻\n\nPilot’s Closing Note\n\nViewed through an aviator’s lens, Ethereum resembles a next-generation turbofan running at high efficiency: formidable compression through rollups, stable burn in the execution core, and a clean exhaust signature through robust finality.\nIn short: the aircraft is flying well, with thrust to spare.", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pj3121/etherum_a_pilots_briefing_on_a_quantumage/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

According to Milk Road on Twitter, ETH ETF's just saw their biggest single-month outflow ever with approximately $1.4 billion in net outflows. This is the largest withdrawal from an ETH ETF since the launch of ETF's. It may look like a terrible metric on the surface but it is important to understand that the overall significance of this metric is a lot less problematic.\n\nThese days ETF flows reflect the amount of demand for an asset. As a lot of investors sell their shares it usually means that risk appetites are dropping. When interest rates go up or stocks dip, as well as any fears about macroeconomics, these events impact negatively ETF flows instead of impacting the fundamentals of the asset itself. Therefore ETH did not 'break' during this time, instead liquidity just declined dramatically.\n\nThe interesting part of this is that as the ETF outflows were happening, we began seeing an inflow of treasury purchases. Milk Road reported that institutions were buying, for example Bitmine added close to 300k ETH during this same period. Once again while retail was panicking and withdrawing funds, institutions were taking advantage of this fear.\n\nETF outflows remove liquidity from the market and create volatility in the short-term, however the increasing treasury inflows will limit future supply and will create a much more robust environment soon, maybe next year. People keep focusing on the bad side of the chart, the smarter thing to do is paying attention to the buyers who stacked quietly while everyone was selling.\n\n[ETH ETF flows turn negative by year-end.

On Twitter, Jrag.eth posted something that is worth reading. Low ETH exchange balances used to be a bullish indicator for ETH holders but that is no longer the case. 6 years ago when ETH left exchanges the typical reason behind it was that the user was holding ETH in anticipation of a future price pump. At the time CEX's were the only place to sell ETH for fiat or other coins so there was an actual supply squeeze.\n\nToday however, things changed drastically for ETH with a lot of the action taking place on-chain through:\n\n* Staking\n* Restaking\n* L2's\n* Collaterals\n* DeFi\n* Etc\n\nTherefore the majority of the people who hold ETH today do it by parking their ETH in one of these methods. And if they want to sell there is no need to send their ETH to a CEX, instead most people simply swap their ETH for a stablecoin without ever having to deal with a CEX. Until now we can see that while there remains selling pressure, the selling pressure is no longer visible using older metrics where CEX's reported their balance on a daily basis.\n\nEven though exchange balances are now reporting to be at their ATL in 10 years and some headlines are calling it a 'tight supply' environment, these factors alone do not necessarily mean that we should expect a huge pump for ETH. This change in market structure means that metrics previously used to determine supply and demand for ETH are now outdated. So if the indicator is outdated why are people still following it blindly??\n\n*Source: https://x.com/Jrag0x/status/1997774217069138203*", "lang": null, "likes": 30, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pi5dde/why_low_eth_exchange_balances_do_not_mean_what/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Anyone attempting to navigate this landscape without acknowledging these deeper currents is, quite simply, mistaking noise for signal.\n\nThe first and most conspicuous feature is the decay of authentic order book depth. The liquidity displayed on major venues is a polite fiction; true resting interest retreats the moment aggression intensifies. The refill ratio, that discreet but indispensable indicator of genuine depth, has weakened markedly. In such an environment, even modest waves of aggressive flow are sufficient to displace price by nearly a full percentage point — the origin of the familiar ±1–2% intraday oscillations.\n\nSecondly, the behaviour of gas fees deserves particular attention. When block costs settle into their current moderate regime, arbitrage engines temper their hyperactivity, liquidation patterns acquire civility, and the entire flow structure becomes almost ceremonial in its rhythm. The result is not a directional impulse but a form of disciplined volatility, wherein micro-retracements frequently complete with mathematical neatness.\n\nThirdly, one must note the gentle indecision of the funding curve. Perpetual funding oscillates about neutrality with a decorum that precludes both exuberant squeezes and dramatic unwinds. It is, unmistakably, a liquidity-led market rather than one steered by conviction.\n\nA Practical Illustration\n\nIn such a regime, the refined practitioner would naturally gravitate toward short-cycle mean-reversion constructs rather than grand directional wagers. One might, for instance, observe ETH dipping into a liquidity pocket around –1.2% from session VWAP, coupled with a temporary widening in the bid–ask spread and a visible thinning of the first three levels of the book.\n\nAt this juncture, a measured long entry with tight risk (0.4–0.6%) and a disciplined take-profit near the mid (0.8–1.1%) becomes intellectually justifiable — not as speculation, but as an exploitation of microstructural regularities.\n\nConversely, should ETH over-extend +1.5% above VWAP on tepid funding and a declining refill ratio, a light counter-trend short, again with modest leverage and narrower targets, would be the proportionate response.\nThese are not trades of bravado; they are trades of literacy.\n\nFinal Remark\n\nUntil depth, refill efficiency, gas behaviour or funding undergo a profound shift, the market will continue to reward not the loudest actors, but the most technically fluent.", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 5, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1phwe87/ethereums_microstructure_on_the_subtleties_that/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

From your experience of DeFi blow‑ups, does it make sense to think in terms of *structural* vs *informational* asymmetry (AS vs AI), or is this just fancy terminology?\n3. If you’ve seen similar attempts at “universal risk constants” in crypto, did any of them survive contact with reality?\n\nGenuinely curious whether the Ethereum/DeFi community finds this sort of modelling useful, or just another theoretical toy.\n\nhttps://github.com/asmyrosgtar-bit", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 2, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1phh681/can_a_new_art2d_risk_model_explain_crypto/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

According to a tweet posted by rostyk.eth, Solana's validator count has decreased a lot falling to below 800 from over 1,900 (2022). This data created some concerns about the future of Solana as a L1 chain. Rostyk.eth thinks that Solana's only real option is to become a rollup on Ethereum, because Solana is spending billions of dollars every year to keep validators running and at the same time, the network is becoming more and more centralized due to the shrinking number of validators and also increasing hardware requirements to become a validator.\n\nThe situation of Solana's validator count has not been simply bad luck, rostyk.eth thinks this is the result of the design decisions that were made when Solana was created. The design choices of the network to scale its validators rely on heavy hardware, this results in less validators and therefore a less decentralized network. To 'fix' this Solana created more SOL to try to keep validators online. The problem is this inflation contributes to the devaluation of SOL and the absence of slashing or security features means the network is forced to continue spending increasing amounts of money to maintain a smaller number of validators. As I have mentioned in previous posts: in the long-term keeping most chains as L1's is not profitable.\n\nRostyk.eth believes that Ethereum L2's were able to grow past Solana because they do not rely on the same level of consensus mechanisms, therefore Solana cannot compete with Ethereum Mainnet in throughput, since increasing throughput requires more hardware requirements.\n\nRostyk.eth's message is that if you are a Solana believer then the safest long-term strategy is to make Solana an Ethereum rollup.\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/rostyketh/status/1997647730118680901\n* https://x.com/KEMOS4BE/status/1997448647198290154", "lang": null, "likes": 49, "replies": 57, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1phdfht/some_say_solanas_future_depends_on_becoming_an/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

The Base Fee oscillating around 0.4 gwei situates the system in what can only be described as a state of serene idleness. This is as close as Ethereum comes to a quiet country estate on a Sunday afternoon: no congestion, no haste, no quarrel for blockspace.\n\nAcross the 25-block sample, utilisation remains strikingly subdued. Many blocks are scarcely filled; only one approaches full capacity. Under the logic of EIP-1559, such behaviour naturally guides the Base Fee gently downward, with the occasional single block nudging it upward again—never aggressively, always within the algorithm’s graceful limits.\n\nIn practical terms, this environment implies three things.\n\nFirst, transactional urgency is entirely absent. The network will include transactions promptly without the slightest incentive. Tips, though available, are largely ceremonial.\n\nSecond, the burn mechanism is effectively dormant. At these vanishingly small fee levels, Ethereum’s deflationary engine contributes only the faintest whisper to supply dynamics. One might say the system is burning incense rather than fuel.\n\nThird, the activity that does persist is mechanical rather than purposeful—dominated by low-margin MEV strategies and automated arbitrage, the quiet clockwork of a market waiting for a reason to awaken.\n\nFrom a market-structure perspective, such calm is rarely decisive. It neither precedes euphoria nor heralds distress; it simply reflects a network untroubled by meaningful flow. ETH’s recent ±2–3% oscillations are entirely consistent with this: movements driven by liquidity conditions rather than fundamental impetus.\n\nWith the network presently operating at an unhurried Base Fee near 0.4 gwei, it is appropriate to consider how such tranquillity might shape Ethereum’s economic profile in the coming days and weeks.\n\n1. The Burn Outlook: A Period of Near-Neutral Monetary Drift\n\nAt current conditions, Ethereum’s celebrated burn mechanism contributes only marginally to supply reduction.\nTo put it plainly: the network is not burning enough ETH to exert any material deflationary pressure.\n\nIf such levels were to persist for an entire month, the effect on supply would be scarcely noticeable. Ethereum remains structurally capable of turning deflationary—but today, it prefers a gentle stroll to a march.\n\nHistorically, even modest increases in transactional intensity—DeFi’s leveraged summer, the NFT manias, periods of elevated liquidations—have lifted Base Fee fifty- to hundred-fold. Under those regimes, burn becomes a market force in its own right. Today’s levels are orders of magnitude below that threshold.\n\n2. Market Microstructure: A Network Awaiting a Catalyst\n\nLow gas often coincides with price ranges such as the one you observed (ETH oscillating within ±2–3%).\nThe absence of on-chain urgency renders Ethereum oddly buoyant yet directionless.\n\nA tightening of volatility, a shift in macro liquidity, or a renewal of on-chain speculation could unsettle this equilibrium. It takes very little—one spirited DeFi rotation, a wave of NFT minting, or a liquidation cascade—to lift gas from 0.4 gwei to 5, 15, or 30 gwei.\n\nUntil such a spark appears, the network is likely to maintain its present composure: quiet blocks, unobtrusive MEV activity, a market that drifts rather than advances.\n\n3. The Historical Contrast: A Sleeping Giant\n\nDuring periods of genuine exuberance, Ethereum resembled a metropolitan exchange at the height of the trading day—crowded, noisy, and expensive. Blocks brimmed with activity, the Base Fee soared, and ETH’s supply curve bent sharply downward.\n\nToday’s environment bears no resemblance to those episodes.\nIt is polite, orderly, and economically tame.\n\nForward Positioning\n\nIn summary:\n\t•\tBurn neutral\n\t•\tMicrostructure docile\n\t•\tVolatility contained\n\t•\tA move will come—but not from within the chain itself", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 9, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ph0u5t/ethereum_gas_conditions_a_discreet_technical/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

This is an error of scale. For two years, ETH has no longer been just another blockchain: it has become the programmable settlement infrastructure on which institutions are silently rebuilding global finance. And this change is much deeper than the price suggests.\n\nThe first disruption is tokenization. In 2024–2025, banks, managers, custodians and fintechs began to switch bonds, private credit, monetary deposits, fund shares, receivables and even structured products to an on-chain version. For what ? Because Ethereum offers something that no banking architecture has ever achieved: a single, programmable, finalized ledger, compatible with any legacy system and capable of operating 24/7. Private blockchains did not win. It is the ultra-optimized and interoperable Ethereum L2s that are absorbing growth.\n\nSecond rupture: the role of stablecoins. 80 to 90% of crypto flows are settled in stablecoins, but the key data is not capitalization. This is the usage. USDC/USDT now functions as a global currency rail, much more efficient than the international banking network. And the majority of these flows pass… on Ethereum and its L2s. The network becomes the de facto basis of the digital dollar on a global scale. This creates a gigantic network effect: the more flows move on-chain, the more the demand for Ethereum increases mechanically (security, data, settlement, finality).\n\nThird break: the modularity of the network. Ethereum no longer tries to do everything on layer 1. It specializes in the “security + finality” layer, while L2s become the new execution environments. This fractal architecture transforms Ethereum into a financial operating system, where money markets, derivatives, deposits, securities, institutional lending protocols or fully automated products can be grafted.\n\nThe 2026 narrative is therefore not “ETH will go up”.\nThe narrative is: finance is migrating to an open, neutral, programmable network — and this network is called Ethereum.\nThe prices will end up reflecting what the structure has already recorded.", "lang": null, "likes": 106, "replies": 50, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pgblgm/ethereum_2026_the_coin_that_everyone_looks_at/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Historically, the business cycle is usually 4 years long, resulting in the 4-year Bitcoin cycle. The current business cycle is slower and set to rise in 2026.

On the last blocks around #23,940,500, network usage remains around 50–52%, well below the peaks observed during the NFT or DeFi mania phases. This explains the relatively low base-fee level: 0.084 to 0.098 gwei, which mechanically reduces the cost burned per block.\n\nDespite this moderate activity, the burn continues: between 0.0023 and 0.0043 ETH per block in the samples you displayed. The majority of blocks display 100% of the 9 possible blobs, proof that the ecosystem is indeed adopting proto-danksharding (EIP-4844). This is a key point: the channel is not underutilized, it is simply more efficient.\n\nOn the production side, we clearly see the domination of MEV builders: around 86% of the blocks come from BuilderNet, QuasarBuilder, Titan, etc. This confirms that the MEV market is very integrated and absorbs the majority of the flow, which avoids extreme variations in gas priority. The validator reward remains low: often 0.012 to 0.022 ETH per block, sometimes a spike when a MEV bundle passes (eg: 0.039 ETH).\n\nIn terms of price, ETH shows a structure very consistent with what we see on-chain. Stable network usage + low base fee = reduced deflationary pressure → ETH remains dependent on the macro narrative and market liquidity rather than an internal shock. Halving churn does not create an immediate supply effect, but it slows down the arrival of new validators, which stabilizes the share of rewards and reduces marginal inflationary pressure.\n\nResult: ETH is today evolving in a technical waiting zone, in range, mainly driven by desks which arbitrate MEV and options. The market prices an environment:\n– almost neutral net supply,\n– moderate but regular burn,\n– very clean fundamentals (full blobs, low gas, stable latency).\n\nIn short: the blocks are clean, the network efficient, the supply disciplined.

JourneyMacro expresses an idea on Twitter that once the world shifts to DeFi, Bitcoin is no longer the asset everything runs through. In a future where trades settle directly between any 2 assets on the same ledger the only thing you actually need is the network's native token. On Ethereum, that means ETH.\n\nHe explains it pretty straightforwardly, if Apple shares can trade directly into Tesla shares, or USD turns directly into RMB, or fractions of real estate swap into wheat futures without a middle step, then you do not need BTC as a bridge. Everything happens atomically on one system. The asset required for every move is the native gas token.. that is ETH.\n\nJourneyMacro's idea connects to another one of his tweets about how Ethereum today is like the internet in 1996, the big players did not even exist back then. And this is what is happening now, once the foundations are set tokenization grows really fast and Ethereum is becoming where those foundations live.\n\nYou can see why institutions are leaning into Ethereum. When all assets in the world run through one settlement layer the value shifts to the asset that keeps that system running. Again, that is ETH.

No indicator offers a comparable level of granularity: the derived metrics (funding, OI, skew) are useful but reactive; Twitter discussions are noisy. The block reflects the operational truth of the network in real time. Here is the full reading based on the latest analyzed blocks.\n\n1. Transactional composition – an organically active network.\nCurrently, the transaction mix shows a strong dominance of swaps, bridging, L2 operations and optimized batches. This composition is very different from phases of “artificial” activity dominated by mint NFTs or spam bots. Here, we observe a functional, useful, clean network activity, which reflects a real use of L2s, DEXs and inter-layer arbitrations. When this mix remains consistent for several hours, it is almost always a sign of stabilization then expansion.\n\n2. Priority Fees – micro-tensions but absence of stress.\nPriority fees experience several micro-peaks, but all very short. This is the typical behavior of MEV arbitrations between L2. What would be worrying: a prolonged peak, an unstable plateau or erratic behavior. Nothing like that here. The network absorbs the peaks cleanly.\n\n3. Gas median – the key variable that many ignore.\nThe median gas remains below 22 gwei, which is a very healthy level for a network experiencing increased activity. This means:\n\t• no congestion,\n\t• no overload,\n\t• no forced blockspace compression.\nThis is exactly the profile of a network “under constructive pressure”. Phases where the median remains low but the blocks are full often precede bullish breakouts.\n\n4. Structural burn – the silent mechanics.\nWithout being explosive, the burn exceeds the issuance on a majority of blocks. These are small margins, but cumulatively they create positive tension. It is this micro-deflation mechanism that supports momentum even when the price seems to be hesitating.\n\nConclusion.\n\t• Clean blocks\n\t• Organic mix\n\t• Absence of stress\n\t• Burn &gt; Issuance\n→ ETH remains in a silent ascending phase as long as this structure holds 24–48 hours.\nTactical zone: 2310.\n\n⸻", "lang": null, "likes": 11, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1pdt7ji/eth_live_reading_of_blocks_the_complete_analysis/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Merlijn The Trader posted a tweet that feels pretty obvious in hindsight. JP Morgan and BlackRock did not end up on Ethereum because of a trend or hype. They came here because Ethereum actually works. Ethereum has 10 years of uptime without a single day where the chain stopped. For institutions that move a lot of money that is the whole point.\n\nAccording to Merlijn Ethereum is slowly but surely becoming the place where the biggest financial players settle value. It is the collateral layer for institutional loans. Ethereum is the system behind their stablecoins and it is becoming the place where global liquidity runs on. These firms do not choose tech for fun, they choose what does not break.\n\nThis is very important if you care about where Ethereum is going. Institutions do not need memes, they do not need hype cycles. What they need is reliability and right now, Ethereum is the only chain that gives them that without compromise. The change is not loud, but it is steady. Every time a major bank runs something on Ethereum instead of a private chain, it tells us this is the settlement layer they trust.

They judge ETH's performance with ETH/USD, which gets mixed together with Bitcoin's price swings, global risk appetite and the usual crypto cycle noise. Ryan says that hides what is really happening to ETH.\n\nThe clean signal is ETH/BTC. By this measure ETH is doing far better than the headlines make it look. The ratio is up about 80% from the Q2 lows which is a huge move for a pair that usually grinds slowly. To Ryan that pump shows stronger confidence in Ethereum itself and not in the broader crypto market.\n\nSomeone in the comments on Ryan's tweet pointed out something similar, that the 'decoupling is happening' since old BTC ranges do not impact ETH the way they used to. For instance a few years ago, BTC under $100k would have meant ETH under $2k, however ETH holding above $3k right now shows the ratio has improved and that ETH is not tied to BTC the way people assume.\n\nIn other words the message here is if you judge ETH by ETH/USD then you miss the bigger picture, but if you follow the ratio you see a network stepping into its own.

Looking at a daily and hourly charts, some key points become evident:\n\n* ETH has followed a pretty clear downtrend resistance line during its recent descent.\n* The recent rally to 3000 USD has also followed a pretty clear uptrend line.\n* ETH is now sitting on the psychological resistance-became-support 3000 USD zone\n* ETH has broken both of them in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe last point is where it gets interesting as breaking the first trendline is the bullish case that the bottom has been reached while the second is the short term bearish case where the recent rally is done rallying at least for the very near future.\n\n**Some key moderator here:**\n\n* This action has happened on a significant US Holiday, might indicate very low significance, in this case I would expect the downtrend to resume from that point. \n\n\n\n[Very clear down trend on daily charts](https://preview.redd.it/n0pv4bxkm74g1.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=065d8102fa96f60e6e471b6db02076e4249bdb65)\n\n[Price action on hourly chart this week. 3000 USD is obviously a key level. ](https://preview.redd.it/f6c4ie0hn74g1.png?width=2622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74d1ab3defc22effb083ba260c2a1f7a677dedd3)\n\n\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\n**Short term:**\n\n  \nI think whatever next move is to be traded for short term traders. Either ETH bounces back up from 3000 and we see at least a fair short term long trade opportunity with a 3500 USD target, or we see it rejects 3000 USD level with a fair short trade opportunity expecting perhaps a double bottom forming over the next 2-3 weeks.\n\n  \n**Mid term:**\n\nI think we either saw an intermediate bottom or the bottom. In any case, the two-months bearish trend will significantly slow down. Ranging between 2700-3000 would get me optimistic for Q2 2026. I think the recent bottom won't be broken down in the near future, if broken at all. \n\n  \n\n\n**There is, however, a mid-term bearish case...**\n\nToday's 3000 is March of 2025's 2000 and one more volatile wave is still coming. Long term weekly charts indicate key zone between 2300-2500. \n\n  \n**... and a counter-bullish case:**\n\nVolume on last week's bottom was the highest since mid-bull wave of August 2025. Even higher than the panic of October 10th week. I would interpret this as a lot of ETH moved from the fearful to the greedy. Volumes were not as high as the precedent drop, however, but still relatively high when compared the post-August run.  \n\n\n[Seems like a lot of positions were taken just below 2500 USD over the last 1.5 year. However, high volume on the last bottom's week.](https://preview.redd.it/www14cv2s74g1.png?width=2453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2c5c87dd5a1c37d053aae0072842319a759feb)\n\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have a bullish bias here I can be wishcasting more than forecasting (see disclaimer below). I made this post mostly because right now, while seemingly quiet, might be the time to be the most awaken. \n\n\n\n***Disclaimer: I am not an ETH investor, but I am performing the wheel strategy on ETHU ETF and am thereby closely interested in what ETH will do over the next few months now that I am in for a while.***", "lang": null, "likes": 9, "replies": 26, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p9s04n/ethusd_in_a_very_interesting_position_right_now/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

I’ve been analyzing different ways to hedge my spot ETH positions during this current low-volume chop. Usually, I would open a short on GMX or dYdX to hedge downside risk, but the liquidation wicks lately have been brutal.\n\nI’ve started experimenting with on-chain \"Volatility Prediction\" instead of directional trading.\n\n**The Concept:** Instead of betting that ETH goes up or down, you bet that ETH will have the **highest percentage move** relative to other assets (like BTC or SOL) over a fixed time frame (e.g., 8 hours).\n\n* **Scenario A (Directional Short):** ETH drops 5%, but a random scam wick hits your stop loss first. You lose.\n* **Scenario B (Volatility Long):** ETH drops 5%. Since this is a bigger move than BTC (-2%), you win the volatility bracket.\n\nNew dApp on Arbitrum called **Candle Wars** that gamifies this. It uses a pari-mutuel pool (winners split the losers' pot) rather than a house edge.\n\n**The Math:**\n\n* If you hold spot ETH and the market crashes, your portfolio value drops.\n* However, volatility usually spikes during a crash.\n* If you win the \"Volatility Battle\" with a small hedge position, the payout (often 3x-5x the entry) can offset the spot loss.\n\nHas anyone else tried hedging via **volatility markets** rather than perp shorts?

The amount of ETH on spot exchanges keeps falling and yet the price does not respond at all. If supply on exchanges keeps falling and price keeps going down then something else is going on.\n\nJourneyMacro says this is not organic. He points to years of 'bear raids,' big players dumping huge stacks of ETH during thin weekend or late-night trading. This creates forced stop-losses, pushes price down fast and lets whales profit on shorts. Anyone who has watched ETH nuke on a quiet Saturday knows something is up. Of course retail sentiment is negative because this hits retail hardest, because this kills trust in ETH as a short-term store of value, even though it is irrelevant long-term.\n\nETH's role as the base asset of DeFi does not change, ETH's long-term value is not dependent on weekend liquidity games. However the short-term damage is real and it keeps regular investors nervous.\n\nIn his tweet JourneyMacro points out that Tom Lee raised an $800 million 'war chest' designed to counter these dumps, the problem is one player will not fix everything. He says the market needs more actors coming in to break these coordinated sell-offs. So in summary the data keeps pointing out the same thing: low exchange supply is not the problem, the market structure is.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/JourneyMacro/status/1993955687358251490*](https://x.com/JourneyMacro/status/1993955687358251490)", "lang": null, "likes": 65, "replies": 57, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p8pmzb/eth_price_changes_show_no_connection_to_exchange/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Recently 'Mastering Ethereum: Second Edition' was released and in a tweet f1go.eth called out a big misunderstanding about ETH: ETH is only a utility currency used to pay for gas. That description made sense.. years ago, but it does not fit Ethereum in 2025.\n\nF1go.eth gives a more precise description, ETH is turning into the reserve currency for the on-chain AI economy. It is also a store of value which already yields more than 2%, while being less inflationary than Bitcoin if you consider actual issuance and burns. Also that yield grows with adoption. And DeFi and restaking make ETH even more productive. It is also the most permissionless collateral across the biggest DeFi ecosystem. Anyone can use it, build with it or lock it into financial apps without asking for permission. This puts ETH in a different category from most assets in crypto.\n\nYes ETH still pays for blockspace but to pretend that is the whole story is to ignore everything that has happened since. If you want to understand Ethereum today, you need to understand what ETH has become and not what it used to be.\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/FigoETH/status/1993951937851441364\n* https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook", "lang": null, "likes": 38, "replies": 43, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p83jv1/eth_is_not_just_a_utility_currency/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Every time ETH nukes, the tokenized asset layer steps in like a giant invisible buy wall. It does not matter if it is stablecoins, RWAs or tokenized liquidity, the growing base consistently catches the price before it goes into a free fall.\n\nYou can see the three big moments on the chart where tokenized assets bottomed out first and shortly after, ETH followed its reversal and it just happened again.\n\nThe interesting part is not just the timing, it is the trend. This tokenized base keeps getting thicker and more assets are moving on chain, stablecoin supply is rising again and RWAs are a real thing. As this base grows, ETH's downside protection becomes more solid.\n\nThe data does not lie, tokenization is real and its shaping Ethereum's market structure in real time.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1993692532245504141](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1993692532245504141)", "lang": null, "likes": 54, "replies": 14, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p7v4nn/ethereums_tokenized_asset_base_keeps_proving_its/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

You do not need to believe in chart astrology to understand why people are paying attention, gold's run happened because the market stopped fighting the trend. When buyers took over the pump lasted years!!!\n\nETH is in a similar spot now but with way stronger fundamentals: cheaper gas from higher block limits, a lot more activity on L2's, more burns and a roadmap that keeps pushing the network forward. What is interesting is that sentiment is so negative and there is so much FUD.

Yes I know the title only mentions Bitcoin and that this is an Ethereum subreddit but bear with me.\n\nDavid Hoffman co-founded Bankless and is an early Ethereum advocate. On Twitter he pushed back hard on a claim that seems never to die: 'If Bitcoin dies, all crypto dies with it.' The idea makes sense.. if you only believe in a Bitcoin-centric view of the world. You should not and Ethereum proves why. David explains that Ethereum has zero technical dependency on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin stopped producing blocks tomorrow Ethereum's stablecoins, dApps, validators, burns and trillions in settlement volume would keep moving without a problem. That is to say the ecosystem stands on its own.\n\nThe point of David Hoffman's post is to teach us about quantum security. Quantum computers threaten chains that expose public keys too early and Bitcoin is one of them. Leading researchers like Scott Aaronson warn that quantum revolution is getting closer and closer and Bitcoiners are now openly getting worried about this. David says this risk is Bitcoin's problem and not Ethereum's, this is because Ethereum hides public keys behind hashed addresses and already has a roadmap for quantum-safe signatures.\n\nIf Bitcoin ever failed because it waited too long to upgrade, David Hoffman says that Ethereum would not collapse with it. Instead Ethereum would likely take the number one spot. The network would keep on producing blocks, burning ETH and running the world's most reliable on-chain economy, exactly as designed.\n\nIf anyone wants to read David's full post I will leave the link at the end of this post, it is quite long but it is worth it!!\n\n*Source: https://x.com/TrustlessState/status/1992553642885316854?s=20*", "lang": null, "likes": 27, "replies": 41, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p69et6/bitcoin_is_not_cryptos_center_and_quantum_risk/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

A better user experience for everyone, from degen traders to Web3 startups or just for people who only touch Ethereum when they mint an NFT.\n\nThis is also cool because Fusaka boosts the whole modular ecosystem without trying to replace rollups or rewrite Ethereum's roadmap.\n\nDecember 3, dont forget that date, it will probably dont affect price in the short term but it will in the long term.\n\nAre you hyped for Fusaka?\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407)", "lang": null, "likes": 24, "replies": 32, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p65zdl/ethereums_fusaka_upgrade_hits_dec_3_massive_ux/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

High Performance L1, AI Transparency, and Airdrop Drama Monad is a high performance, EVM compatible Layer1 blockchain achieving 10,000 TPS with sub second finality, positioning itself as an ambitious alternative to Ethereum for high throughput smart contracts. Crypto transparency is evolving fast, and AI tools now let you track wallet flows, analyze market sentiment, and map positioning in real time. I used Bitget’s GetAgent to check early $MONAD to check out possible trade setup since $MON will be listed on Bitget ahead of the mainnet launch, not trading advice, just observing how people were moving.\n\nThe airdrop caused friction, 289k wallets received tokens while many early testers and contributors were left out, sparking brief #MonadScam discussions, even though interest in the tech remains strong. Tokenomics are tight, with only 10.8% of the 100B supply circulating at launch and a large chunk coming from the $269M public sale at $0.025. Pre market trading around $0.049–$0.05 keeps sentiment tense.\n\nWith Ethereum dominating smart contracts and L2 scaling, Monad’s launch feels like a real world test of whether an alternative EVM compatible L1 can offer meaningful advantages in speed, cost, and developer experience. AI transparency and early wallet tracking give a unique lens on how the community is positioning. The question remains: can Monad carve out real space next to ETH, or will the airdrop drama slow early momentum?", "lang": null, "likes": 3, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p5h9rj/can_monad_challenge_ethereum_high_performance_l1/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

According to AdrianoFeria.eth buying ETH should not be an emotional or hype decision. It should come from a proper understanding of what Ethereum really is.. and that is the part most people skip. His point is that if you do not understand Ethereum, you will default to something else. You will buy Bitcoin because it feels safer, you will buy ZCash because you think it is the only real privacy option, you will chase fast and cheap alt L1's because they look easier to explain. However all of that misses what ETH brings to the table.\n\nEthereum's native yield stays above its issuance which makes ETH have stronger store of value traits than most people understand. The ecosystem already supports privacy through apps and L2's and that privacy connects with real financial use, not just shielded transfers. While other chains brag about cheap transactions Ethereum's rollups let it scale far beyond them without losing security or making it harder for people to verify the chain.\n\nThe message here is not 'buy ETH' but instead 'do not buy ETH unless you understand why it works.' If you can see how the system fits together: security, scaling, yield, privacy, verification, then holding ETH stops being a bet and starts being a conviction.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1992442010523898265?s=20*", "lang": null, "likes": 52, "replies": 61, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p5fvkm/only_buy_eth_if_you_actually_understand_what_you/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

My investment thesis is that ETH will increase price because of increase in its demand, however, the wide adoption of L2 are significantly reducing fees for L1 which reduces yield and the rate tokens being burned. There could be a win/lose scenario where Ethereum becomes like the internet as an infrastructure but all the money are going to AWS and the Googles of the world. It would be a win for the tech and a loss for investors. What is your value proposition for ETH?\n\nFor ETH to reach multiple level of today’s price, there has to be a significant increase in fundamental value proposition, not just buying and investor sentiment.\n\nMy investment thesis:\n1. Digital asset platform for NFT (low impact)\n2. Increase in ETH demand because of usage (stablecoin/ tokens) (high impact)\n3. Yield asset - yield has been dropping consistently (depends on the yield, ppl won’t buy it for yield if they can get better yield elsewhere)\n4. ETF for retirement (only if price has shown to go up as an asset, funds won’t touch assets that do not have good returns)\n5. company Treasury (only works if ETH price goes higher)\n\nSo in summary, the true price driver is the demand for L1 at the current state.

According to researcher Joseph Young, Ethereum is getting to a phase most people are still not paying attention to: real and long-term deflation. The path to this is based on upgrades that change how the network handles data, scales activity and burns ETH. Right now L2's like Base, Arbitrum and Lighter are posting record activity. Most of their data gets uploaded to Ethereum as blobs and every blob fee is paid in ETH and then burned. This alone already matters.. but it is about to matter a lot more!!\n\nThe next Fusaka upgrade (PeerDAS) increases blob throughput from 6 to 48. That is an 8x increase in capacity for L2's to push heavier applications like high-frequency trading or the kind of perps run by Lighter. Simply put: more blobs means more ETH burned. The problem is PeerDAS increases the load for nodes but that problem gets solved by EIP-7928. It removes the main verification bottleneck and keeps block checking fast and predictable even with all the extra data.\n\nTogether these two upgrades combined create a simple loop: more L2 activity → more data posted → more ETH burned → stronger supply pressure. The point Joseph Young makes is that every step Ethereum takes in scaling its ecosystem directly increases the value of ETH itself.\n\n[Graph taken from the tweet.](https://preview.redd.it/7u44tiheqt2g1.jpg?width=1031&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaaa594d87b42f2794b785f621e170755c2a17a)\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/iamjosephyoung/status/1991899406245790143?s=20*](https://x.com/iamjosephyoung/status/1991899406245790143?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 129, "replies": 45, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p3vj3y/ethereums_next_upgrades_set_the_stage_for_real/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

After a certain point, users with higher governance weights don't get new perks. So there's no real milestone / recognition for users who hold a larger amount of Donuts and consistently support the community.\n\nHigh GW users may feel like they're not acknowledged in r/EthTrader.\n\n---\n\n## Problem\n\nUsers with a higher GW are usually the most active and invested in r/EthTrader. And yet some of them may get the feeling that they're not getting anything new from holding or increasing their GW beyond a certain level.

This becomes a new fun milestone and a reward for staying committed long term.\n\nTo keep things simple, in an initial stage users would request their custom flair through mod mail, like this:\n\n* Mod mail title: `Customize User Flair`\n* Mod mail body: `Hello World` (this is the flair's content)\n\nNotes:\n\n* Mods would set the flair manually.\n* Users could update the flair, through mod mail, at reasonable intervals.\n* The flair would have a golden \"500K\" badge attached to it.\n\n---\n\n## Advantages\n\n* Adds a new use case for DONUT.\n* Creates a milestone at 500K governance weight.\n* Encourages long term holding and engagement.\n* Gives high contribution users a visible way to stand out.\n* Builds a better connection between governance participation and subreddit identity.\n* This is very simple to implement.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n* Before automation, more mod mail and manual flair changes, depending on demand.\n* This removes a unique perk from Special Memberships, since custom flairs would no longer be exclusive to subs.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis ETIP gives long time and high GW community members a simple reward that reflects their contribution. It strengthens the connection between governance weight and subreddit identity, adds yet another organic use case for DONUT, and improves r/EthTrader's incentive structure. This also gives more recognition to active DONUT holders.\n\n---\n\nThe choices are:\n\n* [YES]\n* [ABSTAIN]\n* [NO]\n\n*This proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days, according to the [governance rules &amp; guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance/).

Vitalik's keynote this week was amazing and very insightful and Ryan Adams explained it very well in a tweet. In summary Ethereum is refocusing on its L1 and it feels overdue. For years the story has been all about L2's, they are moving fast, they are experimenting and they are doing real work. However the foundation still decides everything and Ethereum's foundation is about to get a major upgrade.\n\nThe plan for next year is simple to understand: make L1 faster without losing decentralization. According to Vitalik new EIP's will push throughput 3-4 times while still letting normal users run nodes. That is important, because a blockchain only works if people can verify it themselves. Bitcoin has around 23.5k nodes, Ethereum has around 12k, every other chain barely exists in comparison. And ZK-EVM stands to push Ethereum into a different league by letting anyone run a full node from a phone, I have talked about this in previous posts.\n\nOn top of this FOCIL reinforces censorship resistance and Ethereum is preparing for when quantum attacks become real. Starting in 2030 all network upgrades plan to make ETH quantum-secure. Bitcoin will not have that advantage.. especially for older coins. Ethereum's L1 is the heart of the system, it anchors DeFi, it anchors every L2 and it anchors ETH's role as a global reserve asset. This is the next phase in Ethereum's growth into the world's financial backbone!!\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1991172751302832498?s=20\n* https://bitref.com/nodes/\n* https://etherscan.io/nodetracker", "lang": null, "likes": 61, "replies": 29, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1p207e0/ethereums_l1_comeback_shows_why_the_base_layer/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

SharpLink recently posted an update on Twitter that proves that the real wealth in crypto comes from patience, not trading (sentimentally). Since the company launched its Ethereum staking strategy in June 2025 it has gained a total of 7,067 ETH in cumulative rewards. Last week alone they pulled in another 492 ETH. And.. they are not selling anything, every bit stays staked and compounding into more.\n\nThis approach should serve as an example for many people, especially the noisiest people on social media. While most investors go after short-term price swings, SharpLink has begun to prove the long-term works better. ETH is one of the few assets where holding actually gives yield in the form of staking rewards that grow over time, without taking on unnecessary risks. That is what they mean by 'the best risk-adjusted way.'\n\nOne may ask why are they doing this?? The answer is simple: Ethereum keeps growing, staking keeps paying and compounding keeps on compounding. SharpLink is letting time and math work in their favor by not cashing out, but rather keeping rewards staked. There is a lesson in here for everyone, if you believe in ETH's long-term value you do not need to guess the next move. You just buy, stake, hold and let the ecosystem's growth pay you for waiting.

That means anyone, anywhere, can join the network and help secure it.\n\nAs you can see Ethereum is not just keeping the lead but it is also increasing the gap, while other chains raise the barrier to entry Ethereum is lowering it. The result is a blockchain that is not just the most decentralized today but is designed to stay that way. Decentralized is also about who actually allows everyone to participate.. and Ethereum does.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/ripeth/status/1987948319398654305?s=20*", "lang": null, "likes": 56, "replies": 30, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ov4zb7/ethereum_keeps_getting_more_decentralized_while/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Ethereum is scarcer on centralized exchanges than Bitcoin.\n\nOnly around 10% of ETH's total supply is still sitting on exchanges compared to 14% for BTC. This might not sound huge at first look but in terms of market structure, it is a massive shift.\n\nFor the past two years, ETH holders have been moving their coins off exchanges and into staking, DeFi protocols and cold storage (dont tell me you hold your coins long term in a hot wallet please). Since the Merge and the rise of liquid staking platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, etc are locking Ethereum into the network itself.\n\nAt the same time Bitcoin exchange reserves has been slowly declining but not as fast as Ethereum's. This trend is shows that ETH is evolving from tradeable asset into a productive, yield bearing on chain economy. People are not just holding ETH, they are using it.\n\nAs you know less ETH on exchanges means less selling pressure and more scarcity that will directly affect on long term price dynamics. It is a matter of when.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1988226476496331119?s=20](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1988226476496331119?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 127, "replies": 61, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ouxz1h/ethereum_is_now_more_scarce_on_exchanges_than/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Built on **EigenCompute**, part of the EigenLayer ecosystem, it connects an ordinary Web2 escrow service to Ethereum’s validator-backed trust model.\n\nIt’s a small project, but it represents something big: the extension of Ethereum’s security into the off-chain world.\n\nThe demo uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) backend and Privy authentication, letting users sign in through standard Web2 methods while the core logic settles verifiably on Ethereum. Developers can fork the repository, deploy it through the EigenX CLI, and run a service that looks like a normal web app but operates under the same type of trust guarantees that secure the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat this shows is more than a technical trick. It is a working demonstration of a new design pattern for how trust itself can be built, reused, and extended.\n\n# 1. Practical verifiability for Web2\n\nInstead of launching new blockchains or validator networks, developers can now anchor traditional applications to Ethereum’s existing security. That makes it practical to build verifiable services — like escrows, marketplaces, or data processors — without needing to reinvent the infrastructure of decentralization from scratch.\n\n# 2. ETH as a universal bond\n\nIn this model, **ETH becomes the reusable foundation of digital trust**. The same capital that secures Ethereum’s consensus can now back independent services, functioning as a kind of economic bond for integrity. Each new application strengthens the network’s relevance, because its trust ultimately flows from Ethereum’s validators and the collateral they restake.\n\n# 3. Familiar experience, verifiable core\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, nothing changes — logins, dashboards, and APIs all feel like the Web2 internet. But under the hood, execution happens in verifiable environments, and outcomes can be proven on-chain. This merges convenience with verifiability instead of forcing a choice between them.\n\n# 4. Broader implications\n\nIf this pattern spreads, it could reshape how the internet handles trust.  \nDevelopers might stop creating new chains for every new idea and instead **reuse Ethereum’s validator base** to secure services directly. A whole market could form around *renting* Ethereum’s trust, where validators, restakers, and developers price and trade cryptographic assurance itself.\n\nIt also means that the boundary between Web2 and Web3 could fade. The same Ethereum security that once applied only to smart contracts could start underpinning AI models, databases, and cloud apps, without users even realizing it.\n\n# 5. A shift in Ethereum’s role\n\nRollups and data blobs scaled Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions. EigenLayer and applications like compute-escrow-privy scale something different: **its trust model**. Ethereum’s reach is no longer confined to blockchains — it’s becoming a **base layer for verifiable computation**.\n\nWhether this model becomes a standard is uncertain, but its direction is clear. Ethereum’s trust is beginning to extend beyond its own chain, out into the rest of the internet.\n\n**Source:** [Layr-Labs/compute-escrow-privy on GitHub](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/compute-escrow-privy)", "lang": null, "likes": 22, "replies": 19, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ou0lfi/ethereums_trust_layer_expands_beyond_the/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

So many people still consider Monero or even ZCash to be the real privacy coins. However according to CloutedMind on Twitter, that is not the case. Ethereum is not branded as a privacy project but it is actually doing more for on-chain privacy than anybody else in practice.\n\nEthereum is the only network that fought the U.S. government.. and won. When the sanctions were applied to Tornado Cash in 2022 the Ethereum community did not give up and it adapted. Developers started focusing on zero-knowledge tech, privacy layers and tools that let users stay anonymous.. while still using DeFi. That last part is very important, you can hold Monero or ZCash all day but what can you really do with it? You cannot connect it to permissionless protocols, lend, borrow or build. ETH lets you do all that and now, it is building ways to do it privately. ZK rollups, stealth addresses, private transfers, it is all happening here on the chain everyone said was 'too transparent.'\n\nPrivacy should not just be hiding your money, it should also be being able to use your assets freely, without permission or exposure. By that standard ETH is not just a privacy coin, it is the entire privacy economy.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/CloutedMind/status/1987601441771360490?s=20*", "lang": null, "likes": 36, "replies": 62, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1otc56r/why_eth_is_the_real_privacy_coin/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.\n\nBefore Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.\n\nBeyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.\n\nBeyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nEvery operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.\n\nAcross Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.\n\nThe effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.\n\nIn parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.\n\nTogether, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.\n\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.

Just crossed with this Everstake [tweet ](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1986783837540569463?s=20)sharing another metric that proofs that Ethereum is very alive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtzrh1kxxzzf1.png?width=2012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6744e2183be19bfd2e09d4c7265437ba5f0d0d20\n\nAs you can see in the Ethereum Daily Gas Used chart above, daily gas usage on Ethereum has been rising consistently for years and 2025 just set another all time high. This is not what a \"dead\" network looks like right? This is what real adoption looks like.\n\nAs you know, gas represents how much computation is happening on the Ethereum network, every swap, NFT mint, airdrop, smart contract interaction or layer 2 bridge burns a bit of gas. Meaning that if gas usage keeps growing, activity is booming, more users, more builders and more protocols are using Ethereum chain as their foundation.\n\nThe good thing is that growth is happening even if most transactions move to L2s like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism. They are scaling on top of it too. Furthermore, validators numbers keep growing and ETH inflation/deflation is currently at +0.799 since burn which is pretty good.\n\nNow you know that Ethereum is alive that keeps building and that its the future, so not lose faith on it, price is not everything and soon it will catch up with the amazing tech.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/eth\\_everstake/status/1986783837540569463?s=20](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1986783837540569463?s=20)", "lang": null, "likes": 44, "replies": 37, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1orknmi/ethereum_daily_gas_usage_hits_a_new_alltime_high/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

Most of the activity came from Lighter, a zero-knowledge perpetuals exchange that recently launched its mainnet.\n\nLighter processed several thousand TPS on its own, temporarily accounting for the majority of Ethereum’s overall transaction throughput. It uses ZK proofs to batch and verify trades on Ethereum mainnet, relying on the blob data system introduced by the Dencun upgrade (EIP-4844) earlier this year. Blobs significantly reduced the cost of posting compressed L2 data to Ethereum, allowing higher throughput without increasing mainnet load.\n\nOther major L2s — Base, Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, and Soneium — contributed smaller but steady portions to the total. The combined activity illustrates how Ethereum’s scalability now depends less on single-chain capacity and more on the aggregate throughput of its rollups.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is central to this shift. By moving large data payloads into blob space, rollups can cheaply record transaction data while still settling on Ethereum’s security layer. The result is a modular system where computation happens off-chain, but finality and verification remain on-chain. The current throughput numbers show that this structure is functioning as intended.\n\nIt’s also clear that the increase came from an application-specific rollup, not from general-purpose usage. Lighter’s focus on high-frequency perpetual trading naturally produces large volumes of small transactions, which are efficient to batch and verify. The performance gain shows what is possible when a specialized L2 design is matched to a specific workload.\n\nEthereum’s base layer remains the coordination and settlement layer for these rollups. The fact that the system can sustain this level of throughput without a network-wide stress event indicates that the scaling path through blobs and rollups is working.\n\nThe next step will be to see whether similar gains appear across other L2s running different workloads — payments, gaming, and general-purpose smart contracts — and whether throughput can grow without centralizing sequencers or compromising verification.\n\nFor now, the data shows a clear trend: Ethereum’s scaling is no longer theoretical.

Right now, Ethereum Layer 2 networks are really booming. Daily transactions across L2s have surpassed Ethereum mainnet multiple times over and the growth is not slowing down. What is coming next is more exciting, Ethereum L1 itself is about to scale in ways that sounded impossible just a few years ago.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum processes 18.6 transactions per second (TPS) which is not bad for a decentralized network that prioritizes security and neutrality. But by 2031, projections suggest it could surpass 10,000 TPS. That is a 500x increase in capacity without sacrificing decentralization or trust lessness.\n\nThis will happen because of the combination of multiple upgrades like Danksharding, Data Availability Sampling (DAS) and Execution Parallelization. All of them together will transform Ethereum into a high throughput trust layer for the global onchain economy, in other words, the base layer that all other blockchains, rollups and dApps can rely on.\n\nThe Ethereum is too slow and expensive narrative is aging out fast and we are entering a new era where Ethereum is not just the settlement layer for crypto, it becomes the foundation for the entire digital economy.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985917494951862463](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985917494951862463)", "lang": null, "likes": 49, "replies": 29, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1oovs2t/ethereums_l2s_are_exploding_in_activity_and/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

In a world where every click, transaction and literally any move online can be tracked, Ethereum might be building the only escape route that really works. According to CloutedMind on Twitter Ethereum's privacy is not something you can copy. Let's see why.\n\n* First Ethereum became the most decentralized and censorship-resistant chain, this has been proven in 2022 when it survived the U.S. government's Tornado Cash sanctions.\n* Then it attracted global assets locking the world's value into its ecosystem.\n* Now CloutedMind says the final step is on its way: going dark with zero-knowledge tech.\n\nZK proofs make it possible for someone to verify something without giving away any details. This means that one day Ethereum could enable private transactions, contracts and identity systems, without breaking functionality or trust. Unlike Bitcoin which continues to be fully transparent, or ZCash that leaks metadata, Ethereum's smart contracts can have practical and composable privacy.

BTC, for example, is almost like a religion for many people, inspiring devotion and loyalty. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is fun, playful, and brings joy to the community. ETH has a very smart and dedicated community, full of knowledgeable people, but at the same time, it can be a bit boring and overly serious. One of the biggest weaknesses I see in ETH is that it has no physical form and there is no effort to give it one.\nI am thinking about some kind of triangular concepts within ETH that are abstract and hard to visualize. They don’t look sexy or fun, and there’s nothing tangible to talk about in casual discussions. This makes it difficult for people to imagine, to create fun posts, or to generate memes related to it. If ETH had some physical form—like a mysterious liquid in a cup, measurable in litres or gallons—it could make the concept more approachable and entertaining. People could make memes like “full fuel tank” or other humorous visuals, which would make the community lively and engaging.\nI don’t think it’s the right time to invest in any crypto at the moment, but after a crash, ETH with some kind of physical representation could become a favorite among cryptocurrencies. It could attract fun people, those seeking a sense of community or “crypto religion,” and still leave room for nerds and serious enthusiasts 😀.\nHere is a visualization I made: https://imgur.com/a/5blJqgU", "lang": null, "likes": 2, "replies": 6, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1onm61c/no_physical_form/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

If you have stablecoins like USDC or USDT in a wallet, it feels like you own them. But you do not, not really. 0xMert_ on Twitter made this very clear, in a tweet he said that you cannot self-custody a stablecoin.\n\nIf you think about it, stablecoins like USDC and USDT are issued by companies. That means they have an on/off switch.. and they can flip it at any time. If regulators or courts demand it they can freeze or blacklist your wallet and this is something that has happened many times before. Last month alone Tether and TRON froze over $300 million linked to 'illegal activity.' A New York court even extended a freeze on $63 million in hacked USDC from Multichain. This kind of control you do not see with cash, or with something far better.. like ETH.\n\nETH lives on-chain, is permissionless and has no central issuer. Nobody can debase it, censor it, or take it from your wallet. This is what is called true self-custody. Stablecoins are convenient, for payments and to move money quickly, but they are not freedom money, they are convenience money. And so if you care about owning what is yours, you should understand the difference. ETH is freedom!!\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1984767763681067174\n* https://financefeeds.com/new-york-court-extends-freeze-on-63m-stolen-usdc/", "lang": null, "likes": 40, "replies": 60, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1on94ry/why_you_cannot_really_own_a_stablecoin/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

To support that, we're adopting a new compounding strategy for our LP position.\n\nFrom now on, monthly reports will have a new section showing updates and deposits into our position.\n\n**2. Rewriting r/EthTrader's topic limiter to use AI instead of regular expressions (?)**\n\nDonut DAO developer u/mattg1981 suggested that we upgraded the topic limiter to use AI instead of regular expressions. Even though regex works, sometimes it triggers false positives, needs manual maintenance and regular updates as new stablecoins / bridges / wallets / L2s / etc come out.\n\nAlso, the tool only checks the thread title. An AI based system could scan the whole thread (title / body / links) for a more accurate classification.\n\nNo one in the team opposed the idea, and it may move forward as a formal ETIP, once we confirm its long term feasibility.\n\n**3. Making the Donut DAO an Ethereum validator, with DONUT rewards for stakers (?)**\n\nDonut DAO contributors had a discussion about setting up an Ethereum validator, managed by the Donut DAO. Community members could also participate, depositing ETH into the pool. In this program, staking rewards would be shared between the treasury and stakers.\n\nWe also talked about rewarding stakers with Donuts.

According to Joseph Young on Twitter ETH is not just having a strong quarter, but it is also building momentum for the upcoming years. When you look at the data it is kind of hard to disagree, let's see:\n\n1. First: Ethereum owns the stablecoin market. Ethereum is currently hosting over $169 billion in issuance which is more than half of all stablecoins in the world. As U.S. regulations get better and more companies go on-chain that number will only grow.\n2. Second: Ethereum completely dominates DeFi. It has over $100 billion in total value locked, a lot of this is thanks to active L2's like Arbitrum and Base. No other network even comes close to this.\n3. Third: Institutions are finally accumulating ETH. BitMine, SharpLink, among others, big firms are treating ETH like digital gold and a treasury reserve for the future. If you take into consideration record-breaking ETF inflows it is obvious there is a lot of institutional demand.\n4. Finally: Ethereum keeps proving that it is the world computer. It has over 10 years of uptime, constant upgrades and an ecosystem of builders that is growing non-stop.\n\nEach of these markets: stablecoins, DeFi, institutions and infrastructure, could support trillion-dollar networks on their own..

You can respect Bitcoin's origin and still admit that Satoshi started the fire, but Vitalik kept it burning.\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1983217640391811115\n* https://x.com/ChillHouseSOL/status/1982990163786584517", "lang": null, "likes": 43, "replies": 38, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ojz0cg/the_two_giants_that_built_crypto_and_why_only_one/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

That includes ETH, stETH, LP tokens, Aave positions, or WBTC — not just stablecoins like USDC. The assets stay on Ethereum Layer 1, continuing to earn yield, while traders open and manage positions on Lighter’s Layer 2.\n\nThe key innovation here is that this cross-layer collateralization is **fully verifiable through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs**, not bridges, oracles, or multisig custodians. Earlier systems couldn’t do this because ZK tech wasn’t mature enough to efficiently prove complex financial state changes (like order matching, margin calls, and liquidations) at scale. Lighter built custom ZK circuits and a specialized “Order Book Tree” that make it computationally feasible to verify every operation — including those involving collateral that never leaves Ethereum.\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Collateral stays on Ethereum (L1)** You lock ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or other supported assets into Lighter’s L1 smart contracts. They remain on Ethereum, keeping their native yield (e.g. stETH still earns staking rewards).\n2. **Collateral is registered in the L2 state** Lighter’s rollup records the locked asset in its state tree so it can be used for trading margin. The L2 handles execution through a low-latency sequencer and proves every transaction with ZK circuits.\n3. **Trading happens on L2** Orders are matched on a central-limit order book. You can trade any listed pair using the collateral value of your L1 assets. None of your assets move unless you’re liquidated.\n4. **Liquidations and settlements are cryptographically enforced** If a position becomes under-collateralized, the L2 generates a ZK proof of the liquidation event. That proof is submitted to Lighter’s Ethereum contract, which verifies it and automatically releases only the required portion of the locked collateral. No human intervention, no trust assumptions.\n5. **Full composability with DeFi** Because assets remain on Ethereum, they can still interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem — earning yield or being tokenized for use elsewhere. The same logic applies in reverse: DeFi positions can serve as margin on Lighter.\n\n# Why It’s Different\n\nPrevious perpetual DEXs and L1 derivatives platforms faced trade-offs:\n\n* **Bridges and oracles** introduced trust and delay (often hacked or manipulated).\n* **Monolithic alt-L1s** like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid had to rebuild their own ecosystems, isolating liquidity.\n* **Optimistic rollups** could not liquidate in real time due to challenge periods.\n* **ZK rollups** before now couldn’t efficiently prove multi-asset financial logic.\n\nLighter’s architecture removes these limits. Cross-margining multiple DeFi assets becomes **provably safe** — verifiable on Ethereum with no off-chain dependencies.\n\n# Why It Matters\n\n* **Capital efficiency:** traders can use yield-earning assets without selling or wrapping them.\n* **Security:** all collateral and state roots are settled on Ethereum; nothing depends on a bridge.\n* **Verifiability:** every trade, liquidation, and collateral adjustment is backed by a ZK proof.\n* **Integration:** native composability with Ethereum means Lighter can plug into existing DeFi protocols instead of competing with them.\n\nIf it works as described, UCM could shift on-chain trading from isolated collateral systems to a **capital-agnostic model**, where any Ethereum asset can serve as trustless margin — something earlier generations of DeFi simply couldn’t do.\n\n# Sources\n\nLighter whitepaper (October 2025) — discusses the core architecture, Order Book Tree, ZK-proof system and collateral logic. - [https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf](https://assets.lighter.xyz/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nInterview on the Bankless podcast with founder Vladimir Novakovski — confirms the roadmap including Universal Cross Margin and the ZKVM sidecar. - [https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex](https://www.bankless.com/podcast/is-lighter-ethereums-l2-perp-dex)", "lang": null, "likes": 5, "replies": 13, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ojut2y/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

This is a shift from \"holding ETH as an asset\" to \"treating ETH as productive security collateral\" SharpLink Gaming (Nasdaq: SBET) announced plans to allocate roughly $200 million of its ETH treasury onto Linea, an Ethereum L2 blockchain developed by Consensys. The ETH will be staked and restaked through etherfi and EigenLayer-based infrastructure such as EigenCloud, with Anchorage Digital providing regulated custody.\n\nThis marks a shift from passive holding to active participation in Ethereum’s security economy. Instead of letting ETH sit on the balance sheet, SharpLink is locking it into validator and restaking contracts—earning yield while contributing to network security.\n\nRestaking, in this context, allows the same ETH collateral that secures Ethereum to also secure external protocols. These can include oracle networks, data-availability layers, or systems like \"verifiable AI\" that rely on cryptographic guarantees. In effect, ETH becomes programmable collateral: similar to gold, but capable of being configured to act as security capital for any protocol, to underwrite its digital infrastructure.\n\nRouting the deployment through Linea highlights how Ethereum’s scaling stack is maturing, and is no longer just a developer sandbox. Corporate treasuries can now interact with Ethereum's cryptoeconomic protocols.\n\nThe broader significance is structural: if more institutions treat ETH as productive security collateral, Ethereum evolves from a transaction platform into a base layer of economic trust whose security can be rented by other protocols.

When most people hesitate, Tom Lee doubles down. The co-founder of Fundstrat and head of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) just bought another 27.3k ETH recently, about $113 million, bringing the company's total holdings to around 3.3 million ETH worth more or less $13 billion. Just to give you an idea that is 2.8% of all ETH in the world, all accumulated since July of this year.\n\nTom Lee's plan is not a small trade, it is among the biggest ever single-entity ETH accumulations in history and it is a big change for BitMine, a firm that used to focus on Bitcoin mining. Today it is making ETH a strategic reserve asset, a bet that ETH becomes the backbone of global finance. Some people say ETH's lack of a supply cap makes this risky, but Tom Lee could not care less. His conviction is the same of early Bitcoin believers but in this case, the bet is on Ethereum's economic machine rather than just on its scarcity.\n\nWhen the announcement came out BMNR pumped 4.5%, meaning that markets might agree with this. As Ryan Sean Adams so well put it on Twitter: 'Tom Lee is either a legend or a fool' because he 'left us no half measures.' In crypto's history those who make bold and insane bets like this tend to write the next chapter.

ETH and it's layer 2s with Base on top have become the top destination for new developers joining the crypto and blockchain space. No matter if they are open source contributors, startup teams or independent builders experimenting with on chain apps, Ethereum keeps attracting the largest share of fresh talent.\n\nOf course there are other that develop on Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche and others but the difference between them and Ethereum ecosystem is so big. Ethereum is the go to blockchain to build on.\n\nThe answer to this is probably a mix of maturity and momentum. Ethereum offers the richest ecosystem of dev tooling, it has a deep liquidity, a big active user base and a very robust funding infrastructure. Ethereum is a complete pack, from smart contract frameworks to rollup SDKs, from DAO to DeFi, this all makes the building phase a lot more smoother and more supported.\n\nThe good thing is that L2s like Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc are also in a good position, telling use that the whole ecosystem is great and that devs knows where the future is going to be.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1982822426045030784](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1982822426045030784)\n* Data: [https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/)", "lang": null, "likes": 22, "replies": 43, "shares": null, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1oix7ku/ethereum_and_its_l2s_dominate_the_builder/", "subreddit": "ethtrader"}

I think it's being suppressed. Whales are loading up while the headlines stay quiet. The same pattern we saw in early 2020, in 2021 and even before the Merge. Every boring range was just an accumulation zone before the explosion.\n\nThis time while waiting I've just been letting my ETH stack compound quietly.

The problem with their logic is that Ethereum is not a company trying to sell products or earn profits, instead it is a settlement layer. Ethereum is the system where digital money, assets and agreements live and move. This system is the foundation of the on-chain economy, when you understand this you start to see why Ethereum matters.\n\nETH is not something you trade for quick profits, it is the infrastructure that future finance will settle on. Every stablecoin, NFT, dApp and tokenized fund built on Ethereum is part of a bigger change.. one that is onboarding the next generation of investors.
